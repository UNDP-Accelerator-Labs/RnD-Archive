# Experimenter\-Colombia\-Juan David Martin

### [[0:00]] For me, tell me your name, your title, and I consent to this recording\.

My name is Juan David Martin\. My title is head of experimentation in Columbia country office\. I consent this interview\.

### [[0:17]] Fantastic\.

### [[0:20]] Right now, should I start?

Yes\. Now you can start with this question\.

### [[0:24]] Yeah\. Could you tell me about our research and development activity you'd like to share?

I would like to share a project that in 2020\. So this is a COVID frame project, which became kind of a flagship project that we, we engaged with several actors, we engaged with a country office\. So it helped us a lot to position ourselves as a accelerator lab in the country and in the country office\.

### [[0:54]] How did it come about? Where, where did it start?

[[tactics:Allies and champions]]
[[tactics:Systems thinking]]
[[principles:Human centering and adaptability]]
[[tactics:Proof of concept]]
So it's March 2020\. We are here in Latin America that there's, there's this sickness that is called COVID that is killing a lot of people in the, in the East, then in Europe\. And we thought it was very far away that to reach us\. And suddenly we started kind of testing the, the ways this, this challenge was being tackled was going to be the way that we're going to manage it in, in, in the countries in Latin America that was putting people into their houses\. So at the beginning, I think when they said they were going to, we're going to have being quarantined during one weekend, we thought this is extreme\. Then it went into a week, then it was a month, then it was six months\. So we never, we never understood how complex was this the COVID was going to be and how much impact it would have in people's lives\. So one of the, one of the things that also helped us to position ourselves is usually when you have a, a complex problem, you have a One Direction, not systemic way of tackling it, right\. So what happened with COVID, there was only One Direction that was that's been tackled and it was health\. It's not a minor one, but so the decisions taken by government and by countries was like we should prioritize health and you can't get sick, so get into your house\. That was it\. And if you think on probably it's all the all the world, but there are people that depend on daily living to be interacting with other people\. But at that point, we're so in panic that anything that the government would tell us, it will be a guidance on how we could tackle this near death experience because that was like the way our behavior works\. Like if I'm going to get sick, probably I'm going to, I'm going to die\. So we started thinking if we are going to put people away just to isolate themselves in their house, what's going to happen with vulnerable populations that depend on that they live in? So we started to make this framing on understanding what does it mean to be isolated and why would you isolate someone of a, of a sickness that you are acquiring it when the, the particles of that sickness get in contact with your eyes, nose and mouth\. So we're, we're just following instructions\. We're getting in panic at that point\. Country obviously already made some research and what would it mean to the economy of the country that people were going to put away for one month, three months, six months? It took over that that time? What would happen with mental issues, what would happen with a lot of businesses? I mean, it was not only the people that lived in the street, but, but factories were, were shutting down\. So we thought, what if we isolate not the whole body, but only the area of our of our body that is going to get sick, right? At that point, we've made an analogy\. What happened with AIDS, you know that you have to protect the part through which you're going to get the disease\. So we created this project called Life Helmets\. So we thought about a helmet\. What if we just cover our heads and continue our daily life? The other aspect of that was behavioral, in which another measurement taken was the use of masks, like mandatory use of masks, which gave you kind of a sense of false security because if I'm wearing a mask, nothing has happened to me\. But then you saw in the public transport, people were taking it because it's uncomfortable and we're not used of wasting face mask\. And the fact that was so uncomfortable would make people touch even more their face because they were they were they were actually putting their hand in the face\. And the other element was thinking, I'm only get the disease if someone coughs in my face\. So there were several elements that biased your behavior towards the sickness\. So we were also trying on having a helmet that you wouldn't probably touch the surface that had someone had coughed 30 minutes before\. I mean, you don't it didn't even had to see the person\. And then you touch it with your hand and probably get your hand inside out of your head\. So we made like first of all, we start designing what would be a life helmet\. We work with makers who had an idea on our heads what could be a life helmet\. So we went to the makers and said we have this project\. This was already taking the makers out of their houses like to reactivate themselves also because we understood a cue that was happening worldwide and were makers that were finding solutions to the some of the, the lack of medical instruments, right\.


### [[5:59]] So you saw the makers making all the, the tubes for the masks in the hospitals developing respirators\. So they were actually seeking the, the, the solutions for, for this problem to, or to help mitigate it\. Could you help me further define what a maker, what constitutes a maker and, and how is it that you came in contact with, with this particular actor to participate in, in, in your research and development project?

[[tools:Quasi expermental design processes]]
[[tools:Design]]
[[tools:Innovation challenge]]
[[tools:Miro]]
Yeah\. What happens sometimes in crisis situations, because this is a crisis situation, is that you fastly identify and, and take decisions fast, right? So I'm a designer\. I had already been in contact with makers\. I had some ideas in my head and I, I know the maker community\. So I approached 11 friend and I told him help me build this prototype that I have in my head, which is a life helmet\. So we made low Prof, low, low tech prototypes like using a bag in a, in a face, like just testing what would it be to have a life, life helmet\. But they actually help us show people what did a life helmet mean? Like we have this approach on that if you can't access your head, your face with a hand and that if we isolate only the head, not yourself in the house, we can tackle this problem\. So they help us build some prototypes, actually start showing people what we had in our heads\. And it was like fast building the solutions\. It not long time that usually sometimes the processes take too much time in the research, then having the insights probably have some hypothesis and then prototype\. We had some intuitions, some initial kind of approach and then makers helped us put that into a product\. So that was our approach to the maker community\.


### [[8:02]] OK\. And were there any specific tactics or approaches you used to engage stakeholders?

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[tactics:Systems thinking]]
[[tactics:Getting in there]]
[[tools:Design]]
Yes, there's a there's a theory about it's using a psychology, it's called a boundary object\. So we have something to communicate, communicate our ideas\. So with these initial prototypes, we showed it to government\. So the Vice presidency became part of this project\. We showed it to the industrial association, to the head of the industrial association\. So they became part of this project\. We showed it to Academy because there was research behind that and they became part of the project\. So we had several actors that became engaged in our idea on of having life settlement and how we understood what was going to happen for the recovery of the country, specifically socio economic recovery of the country when it was this was happening on COVID\. So that was our tactic, like having something that we could show people get engaged and then make them part of the project\.


### [[9:09]] And what were the ethical considerations of what were the main ethical considerations to take into account during this project, considering the aspect of health and emergency that was going on at the moment?

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[principles:Trust]]
[[tools:Design]]
[[principles:Inclusivity]]
Well, there, there was a, there was a couple of things that we're different during COVID times, right? So there could be an approach of ethics on what was going to happen with the designs of the maker community\. I mean, how are we going to respect their intellectual property on this? We didn't prototype with communities\. I mean we designed a product that was out of the street fast\. So the ethical part, I think we were prioritizing having something that was protecting not that we didn't had into account that part, but it was as we were not directly working with our community\. So it was not, not something that we were so much concerned\. So we knew that our process on, on having these ideas were and the respect of those ideas was going to be essential\. And just in parallel on having those prototypes, we had an open innovation challenge\. We're open to open to the whole country\. Actually, it was something that the presidency helped us like to put it out there because they also thought that having this kind of solution, we're going to help the country\. So even the president had one of our prototypes, the president talked every day to the country and he had one of prototypes in front of him\. Like we have to protect themselves\. So what we wanted with innovation challenge was not only have the ideas, but do people become aware that they, they had to take care of themselves\. It was not only having a mask to protect, but they, they should be aware not to be touching your face\. Who are you talking to? If you have a flu, well, protect yourself\. So it was how to isolate the sickness\. And when we are talking about opening the recent challenges again, there's a lot of topics about proper in the intellectual property that we were taking into account\.


### [[11:29]] Now can you reflect on any type of barrier or resistance that you found during this R&D journey and what were the tactics or approaches that you used in order to overcome such barriers?

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[principles:Flexibility and adaptability]]
[[principles:Inclusivity and diversity]]
[[principles:Diversity]]
I would say we were actually going like having a parallel way to barriers because we were finding a solution\. So for example, why was this interesting to the to the industry? Because we were reactivating some industry that were developing the products\. When you have that you have, you're activating the whole value chain, right? So you're offering a solution to the barriers\. So we had a big barrier\. COVID was a big barrier, people in their houses was a big barrier and we found a parallel way to overcome it\. So when there's chaos, there's a, there's a, when you have crisis, innovation comes in easier because when you're like in panic and you, you see everything is going bad\. Innovation is a solution that you, it's easier to have an innovation project when you have chaos or crisis than just today\. Or I have an innovation here that you could use\. People are we are very used to our daily life as it is\. So something new\. Maybe it's just like I'm not going to appropriate it in a way that when you have a crisis, you're going to appropriate it\. So we had more barriers on the side that probably it was difficult to tell people go out in your house because we had we in our biases and our heads\. We had already too much panic\. That would be a barrier that we were trying to overcome\. Tell them even, OK, we want to reactivate your industry, but take care of yourself\. So the barrier was to make people get out of their houses\.


### [[13:28]] How about the cost for the end user related to other solutions that were out there available?

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[tactics:Systems thinking]]
[[tools:Quasi expermental design processes]]
[[tools:Design]]
We had two approaches on that as we were, we had the makers initially, which are makers not thinking about sustainability under design\. I mean they, they're having a solution\. Sometimes it's not scalable\. But as we had another stakeholder, which was the industry and we were working with the prototypes of this, taking them to industry, the industry already had could, could, we could have a price, right\. There was already a price that was cheap because it's plastic and you have the industrial process, probably stamping, it's not so expensive\. We, if you're thinking about economy scales, we were not going to produce 10\. We're going to produce probably thousands that what's happened\. We produced thousands of that, but we still knew that there was some vulnerable populations that this was going to become very costly, right\. So we built a marketplace where people would buy our solutions given the proper intellectual rights to the if it was an industry, if it was maker\. So we have several, several life helmets that were complying on what we were we were trying to achieve, which was you can't access your face with your hands\. And what we had there is you buy 1, you donate one because we were trying to reach both our vulnerable populations, right\. Not that we were not interested in the other ones, but they were the ones that needed to go to the street to actually make a living\. So the cost, there was some cost that people with the resources were helping the people with less resources to acquire those, those masks\. But again, they were not expensive\. They were a bit more expensive than the mask, like the, the Keurigic masks, but it would also last longer, right? This, this shield would last a lot longer than the, because it's supposed that you would only be using it once or probably you're going to use two during the day\. So that was the way that we manage cost\.


### [[15:37]] Now you mentioned how the starting point presented a challenge for sustainable development, but you were trying to understand the multi dimensionality of it in in different dimensions\. So can you reflect on the skills that were needed to effectively identify and understand this multi dimensionality of challenges that posed other than just the health issue?

[[principles:Even when the Lab is not there things should continue]]
[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[tactics:Desiging the pipelines]]
[[tools:How might we]]
I think one of the things that we are equipped as Accelerator Labs is that we understand that little decision today is going to have a big impact tomorrow\. So think about the foresight on what's going to happen with COVID, what's going to happen if we are logged in our houses for so much time\. So we identified a possible future on that and we built and constructed toward that future\. So understanding that we need a solution now for impacting the future is something that we that is very important for the labs, right\. Pertinence is something that is really relevant for us\. I mean, we could be, we could be thinking about a solution and maybe if it takes too much time as public policy\. So today I'm going to have a planning\. I have to do the research after research, I have to do some, some document that is the policy, then we're going to implement it\. It takes too much time for a problem that it's solution right now\. So, put your like your ideas in your hands, make something tangible, which is another thing, especially as experimenters, we have to make things tangible\. It's a skill that is really relevant that makes pertinence on what we're showing\. The other one is thinking about who else is needed on this\. So it's not me making a project for myself\. I'm going to have the gains of this\. If we're looking real impact, we have to have an idea and deliver it to someone that's going to scale it better than us\. It could be the industry again, it could be government, but we have an initial idea that we have to deliver to someone else\. And that's something that is not too common even sometimes in UNDP when you think of a solution, you build your project, you have your resources and then you implement\. So that's one of the things that's accelerated labs we could have on how is this project going to detonate a lot of things the portfolio approach, how is this little idea is going to impact on the long term And I could start putting more stakeholders, more projects because you're looking for an impact on a specific territory or population that that we can articulate and foresee again, using foresight as Accelerator Labs to have a scale\.


### [[18:30]] Now apart from a successful prototype, what other outcomes you think this R&D journey have and in what dimensions of sustainable development do you believe it impacted?

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[tactics:Getting in there]]
[[tactics:Systems thinking]]
[[tactics:Desiging the pipelines]]
When we began this project, I mean we didn't foresee what was going to be the impact\. But when we showed it to government, they was, they identified like these guys are thinking something else from the rest of the people\. They saw a spot that we were not thinking about and it is this kind of what they saw as an innovation project for us it was an R&D process\. So they got government and industry and allies to see how are these people making good alliances in such short amount of time and a product\. So what happened is USA got interested into this project\. They were interested in our approach to economic recovery because this was a little a little element\. I mean having this mask or helmet, they were not going to make the country covered from this impact of being locked, but we had an approach\. So impact of this was USA got really interested in this project, interested on how on the pertinence and the time we build it and we build a portfolio with them $12 million for economic recovery\. It was not about the masks\. It was about the approach and the learning was hot little things can we do to show allies that as we call it in the office, you put that your foot in the door to make a possibility of work with them\. So that's been a strategy\. Also have the lab and how we make little things to make people interested and then possibly make a portfolio or a bigger project with the with the allies and government\.


### [[20:21]] And now reflecting on the learnings, if you were to start again, having gone through all the process once, what aspects would you approach differently?

I would or we, well, the lab would have put less effort on taking too much time\.

### [[20:50]] Just want to let you know we're going\.

### [[20:55]] I'm wrapping it up\. It's the final one\.

### [[20:58]] Appreciate it\.

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[principles:Recognize and promote agency]]
[[tools:Design]]
[[tactics:Getting in there]]
[[21:01]] So no\. So the I would have put more responsibility in the industry\. I mean, they were like kind of a only taken advantage that we were issuing this these letters for them to transit to the work to reactivate their value chain\. But at some point that they were leaving their responsibility of, of what we were aiming and just take it, taking it the advantage of that\. So I would have put them in more of an essential role that they would have more responsibility on the on what we were achieving and not leave it till the end, taking them like the final designs for them to produce, but having more stake on all the projects\.


### [[21:46]] Thank you very much\.

Thank you\.
