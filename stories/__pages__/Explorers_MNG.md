[[tools:Portfolio approach CPD]]
Sure\. So I can share stories that we've been tasked to develop portfolios last year\. So you know portfolio approaches a new kind of approach that we designing and implementing the projects\. So as a part of that bigger portfolio development, we've actually initiated futures foresight exercise\. So, so is this year we continue\. So last year actually within this portfolio we actually tried to you know, nurture and to introduce this tool to country office\. So as part of that portfolio, we have organized series of trainings what's about this features foresight exercise for the internal stuff, project stuff and program stuff\. And we've actually formed the volunteer group for signal scanners and we did, we collected a lot of signals around the sustainable livelihood and sustainable environment, sustainable finance during that exercise\. And afterwards we've analyzed together with the volunteer scanners to to developed this signal spotlight for sustainable livelihood in Mongolia context, 


### [[2:10]] who was the involved and what was their role? How did the input safety around this zoning right\.

[[tactics:Getting in there]]
[[tools:Design]]
[[tactics:Systems thinking]]
[[tactics:Gaining leverage and traction for solutions]]
So that's so that was our first attempt to introducing this fortress foresight methods and tools to \*\*\*\*\*\* country office\. So we yeah as I mentioned before, we have recruited like volunteer signal mappers from the different projects\. We had in total like a 12 volunteer scanners from the different projects around the systematic areas of sustainable livelihood, sustainable environment\. And yeah, so that was the first phase of for our exercise\. And now actually we are scaling it to the national level and we inviting all sorts of different stakeholders\. So we are working with the mainly presidential office of Mongolia and also with the private sectors, NGOs and yeah, various different organizations including the International Development, other organizations\.


### [[3:22]] What was the impact of our outcomes of your R&D?

[[principles:Curiosity]]
[[tools:Design]]
[[tactics:Gaining leverage and traction for solutions]]
[[tactics:Creating space for emerging themes]]
So the main purpose of this our first phase of this features and first sight exercise was feeding this new to actually capturing the new trends and new, yeah, the signals that potentially influenced our the program areas, portfolio areas of this sustainable livelihood and sustainable environment\. So for this year's actually we are expecting to have this thematic area chosen as a green transition\. So we are exploring the different alternative future scenarios for Mongolian green transition\. So we are expecting this outcome so this year for green transition\.


### [[4:16]] So how did you with your project, how did you engage with the policy makers, private sector community and other actors to catalyze broader change or impact on your right work?

[[tactics:Gaining leverage and traction for solutions]]
[[tactics:Getting in there]]
[[tactics:Systems thinking]]
[[tools:Design]]
So that that's the difficult part of course\. So this is the kind relatively new topic, new methodology from Mongolian case\. So we would like to get buy in from the other stakeholders to really like a showcasing demonstrating how this can this methodology can utilize their work and to to positively impact their work\. So we've made the series of workshops, also series of bilateral meetings with the different stakeholders\. And of course it's hard to convince them, you know, it's like the conducting their, you know, work so many years that there's certain, you know, approach they usually use\. But it's a we are like introducing kind of new approach, adding first\. It's this feels like it's in adding there, you know, more jobs\. So we've tried to frame it\. It's like should be like complementary, not like adding and it's complementary what the deems\. So it's kind of the approaches what the skills we are needed to effectively identify understand the challenge or need that or need that your resist and development right\. So of course, it's first like as advocating, right\. So advocating that why this new tools can you know or can or should be using in different different settings\. So it's kind of quite of advocacy work and then like also pitching, you know, the, the your idea to get buying and also in terms of the execution wise\. So also you have to have a really good like project management skills as well\. So it's like a research project\. So we have to have also timeline budgets and within this budget timeline, you have to deliver the results\.
