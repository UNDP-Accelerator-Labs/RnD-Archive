# Experimenter\-Cameroon\-Roberteau Chaufo Sesh

### [[0:00]] Please tell me your full name, your title and say I give consent to this recording\.

I'm Chaufo Sesh Roberto, I'm the head of experimentation at the UNDP, our own country office, and I give consent for this interview dance\.

### [[0:21]] Great\. Over to you for the first question about RT\.

### [[0:53]] Can you could you tell me about the R&D activity that you did in Sure\.

I would like to share with you this R&D activity that we carry out to try to develop a solar power mobile kiosk to help St\. youth to conserve and to try to to be able also to improve and to innovate in their catering services\.

### [[ 1:33]]  Interesting\. How did it come about? Where did it start?

[[skills:Volunteering and taking initiatives]]
[[principles:Curiosity]]
[[principles:Recognize and promote agency]]
[[skills:Delegation]]
OK, those 3 youth, many of them are on the road due to poverty in their family, due to some attention in their family too\. And what they are did is to try to survive and to survive some, some of them sometimes are involved in illegal activities, but they are another one really to come out in this from this vicious environment\. So we wanted to give them or to try to help them to try to increase their resilience to be able to generate more income, to be able to, to to really integrate in the society\.


### [[2:32]] What was the development issues that you you were addressing If you need to in a specific OK\.

The development challenge was in term of how to increase their resilience\. Because on the street, like I said before, they are facing a lot of challenges\. They are don't have where to sleep, they don't have what to eat and they are very, very vulnerable\. So you wanted to see how this can help them to be more resilient and to be able to really integrate in the society and don't even involve in illegal activities in the cities through this process\.

### [[3:23]] Who was involved in your journey? What their what was their role? How will you ensure that there are the all stakeholders that or different stakeholders move with you in this in this process or journey?

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[principles:Recognize and promote agency]]
[[principles:Curiosity]]
[[principles:Care about the people the same amount you care about the solutions]]
In this journey, we involve the government back and we tried together to see what is the legal framework in them of taking care of those special type of population, if I can speak like this\. And we also involve those St\. youth who are in the street and we also involve the program colleagues who are working on those topic\. And we tried to collect data to speak with all those people to better understand the challenges and also to share with them the potential solution that we were thinking that it should be the solution to address this issue\. And everybody was able to share what he think about and to give us the feedback\. And we tried to analyse to come out with the concrete challenges regarding this this issue\. And we were able also to, to, to, to, to understand that or to another if this hypothesis of Solar Mobile kiosk could be really a solution\.


### [[5:02]] OK, I need to ask you about the techniques that you use, specific techniques or approaches that you use\.

[[tactics:Systems thinking]]
[[tactics:De-risking the intervention by promoting an incremental approach trough R&D]]
[[skills:Pitching skill]]
[[tactics:Based on petition get the message to the right person]]
OK, interesting\. We, we used to, to, to to really I can say this, sell the idea to our resident representative and our deputy resident representative who was like the advocate in term of idea\. You know, usually R&D activities is really different on how program are working and sometimes it is not easy to convince people that we can take these activities and so on\. So we try to use this strategy and the senior management team was like our advocate and this enabled us to carry out our R&D journey until the end\.


### [[6:09]] Thank you\. OK, let's talk about the impact on the outcomes\. What was the impact of the, what is the outcome of your R&D journey?

[[principles:Curiosity]]
[[tactics:Play do not preach]]
[[skills:Reaching unreachable communities]]
[[principles:Inclusivity and diversity]]
OK, interesting\. The first one that I will mention was that when during the test of the kiosk that we developed, we realized that this increased the income of those street used by 60% during the period of the test\. And the second thing is that this make the people look those young people differently\. And for instance, 1 development partners who come and see those innovative kiosk, those young people differently\. He decide to sponsor their training on catering services in this very, very famous restaurant of the city\. And 12 people were trained and in the way to diversify their offer and be able to really increase their income\.


### [[7:23]] That's really important outcomes\.

Thank you\.

### [[7:28]] I need to ask you one question\. If you had to start again the, the initiative or the intervention solution, what would you do differently?

[[tactics:Systems thinking]]
[[tactics:Negotiation]]
[[tactics:Based on petition get the message to the right person]]
[[tactics:Getting in there]]
I think what I will do differently will be maybe to, to, to see how with the procurement team we can found a better way or the right way to really deal with this type of activities\. You know, when you, you, you have to carry out this type of activities, it's different\. How the country office deal with procurement, with procedure and so on, is to find ways\. The better way, because you know, we need, it is an innovation starting\. You don't know exactly what this will look like\. You just move with an agile approach and at the end you have something\. So it is how we try to see how to, to, to, to really engage all the stakeholders by the beginning so they can really understand how the process will move in during the the journey\.


### [[8:47]] The last question, how did you engage with the policymakers, private sector and the communities in your process in this process for R&D world?

[[principles:Empathy]]
[[principles:Inclusivity]]
[[principles:Human centering and adaptability]]
[[skills:Common grounding]]
OK, I will\. I will mainly mention the communities because to test, we wanted to, to work with an organized communities and we identified an association, a civil society organization named Okalukuped dealing with those issue of Sweet youth\. And this was very interesting because they really know the challenge facing by those people\. They were able also to identify the right people to test and the right people who they can trust them to, to do the test to, to, to move in during this journey\. And it was very, very interesting\. And during the test also, they were the one to lead to interrupt with municipalities, with the mayor, with other stakeholders\. So it was very, very interesting experience at all\.


### [[10:05]] Thank you so much, Roberto, for your time and for your insight\. Thank you so much\.

Thank you very much\.
