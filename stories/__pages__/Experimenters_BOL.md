# Experimenter\-Bolivia\-Diego Suarez

### [[0:00]] Please tell me your name, your title and say I consent to this recording\.

OK\. My name is Diego Suarez\. I'm Head of experimentation of UNDP Bolivia\. And yes, you can share the conversation\. I agree with this\.

### [[0:16]] Over to you for the first RND question\.

OK, Thank you very much\.

### [[0:21]] OK, there you go\. I want to know a lot about you\. We have seen only online for sometimes\.

Yeah, very interesting for me\.

### [[0:28]] And even we made in person\. I don't we have something in common\.

I don't know what it is\.

### [[0:33]] That's why I want to pair up with you and learn more about you\. But please start about tell me a bit more about yourself, your name, your title, how long you have joined the lab\.

[[principles:Even when the Lab is not there things should continue]]
[[tactics:Getting in there]]
[[tactics:Desiging the pipelines]]
[[tools:Quasi expermental design processes]]
Yeah, well, I have been in the second cohort on 2020 of September of this time was very nice because these two first, yeah, two first years I was we was talking right now for me was very important because was learning about what was the accelerator lab because we have to be only working three months, have results, try to be inside the country office something like was very, very good for us, was our DRR support us very, very good\. Like I remember the first week was like Deseretop lab have to work with everybody\. It's not external\. They don't have to do our own research\. They have to work with governance, with environment, with SDGS or all the people can do it\. And was very good because we started realized that in Bolivia we don't have, for example, data\. We don't have that it's something like it's an issue in the country\. Yes\. For example, with the municipality for them have some planification to develop and the activities for the people of the citizens\. It's like doing day per day, but we don't structure\. And I saw there that it's for us was very important because we start working with the people and changing the way because something like also was very important to work in this and the experiments and all the research on the Bible and that we are working, work with 10 people was amazing\. First of all, of course, the contrary was like, what are you doing? You have to work with the government\. You have to work with 1000 of people\. And I was doing one experiment very slow, like 20 people and was very good to understand what's going on there, do the experiment and understand learnings\. And then we scale\. We have one project that is the name is MI Barrio that we started working with the neighborhoods that the, the, how they after the pandemic or in pandemic and they start having a new way to understand and participation, citizen participation was very important\. And the municipality, we were in the in elections, but the municipality was like, I don't care this one\. And we start going more deeper with these people and they understood that the that the information about the participation was very important\. And they start growing\.


### [[3:43]] Can I ask you to not respond to this?

I know it's hard because I want to do something\.

### [[3:56]] Sorry\. Go ahead\. Can you tell me a bit about your background?

[[tools:8 Elements (or Steps) for Policy Innovation]]
[[tools:Design lens]]
[[tools:Urbanist AI]]
[[tools:Quasi expermental design processes]]
OK\. Oh, perfectly OK\. I was I was like, yeah, I'm an architect\. I have a master in about digital architecture\. Yes, was a nice he's a nice profession and in the pandemic before UNDP, I create, design and construct respirators for the pandemic for the people we fabric like 300\. I put it in the rural areas with a lot of problems about health and respirations and everything\. And I realized that that was the click for me was like, I we need to change because we have to work in the people with\. And because I went to the hospitals to, to see how I was going to things and see a lot of gaps and issues that we have it and I have that experience and I was, I have my own company to, to design a construction\. I left now is, is not anymore\. And, and I was a teacher in the research teacher in the university doing digital things with design digital architecture with my students\.


### [[5:15]] Wow, that was interesting\.

And that's my thing\. I feel something that you can we can communicate because I work with a lot of architectures even for the team that another team she has another architect and another team working at the with the urban city\. They are also architect and interest the way they see the world, the way they decide, the way they what is this standard of function\.

### [[5:42]] So I think this yeah, my question, yeah\.

[[tools:Quasi expermental design processes]]
[[tools:Design lens]]
[[tools:Visual thinking]]
[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
And that was the thing also that I, I it's like I always say, like an architect, if you draw or you are 3D model, it's good\. But if you don't have a construction is the construction is the final thing that you have\. And I think for me was the thing that I did it in this respirator and also all these experiments that I have\. It is like we need to go to the ground to work with the people to start thinking about it, the next steps and going in the ground because I it's, it's, it's very important, I think\. And well, the question about this project of my barrio with the neighborhood people, the citizens\. And we realize also inside that they started to say, if I have some information, I can take decision with the neighborhood association\. And we capacitate these people to give the tools, for example, Gobo tools to take some information\. And the young people of the neighborhood went to the houses to do the pilots to say hi, how are you, how you doing? The pandemic was hard\. Are you working? You have Wi\-Fi and they start giving some information that after that information, they can have some evidence to have this planification\. And we started with the one small neighborhood to create this platform, digital platform\. But something like it's very nice for this platform is that the neighborhood association take the information, not the municipality\. And it's like we empowerment this citizens to have what they want to have in this platform\. For example, economic things, courses, learnings, all the things\. After that we start working with the municipality\. We, I went there and it was difficult because when we was doing this ethic and it's not ethics, this discussion, the diffusion, sorry, of all the, the workshops that we start with working with people\. The second ring was start working with somebody of the municipality to say, look, this one, this is a platform that is working\. The people have the power, you are the implementer of this because you are the municipality you need to contact and try to do for more\. They took us like six months or five months to convince to show everything\. And then we redesigned the experiment about not only have this capacitation and this value to the citizens, people, the idea was like going more than also the municipality\. And we took like some we, we did, I don't know, like a lot of workshops learning about how they can also take information, how he's working the platform, how can be the administrator, how you can have all these kind of stats, go to take the surveys, everything\. And then now in the third ring, the municipality is they have this platform for all the municipality they have about, I don't know, 25 big play neighborhoods and they put it information and it's actually going\. And if you go to the principal, it's they have like cities in participation is the new way to have this because we have young people working in that and the municipality realize that they have to change how they see the citizens and try to have this interaction\. Yeah, yes, something like that\.


[[9:46]] Interesting because So what is the biggest difference working at the community level and municipality? Why is the resistant, I'm not sure you said where they can use resistant from there\. And how is it easy or modified when you scale up from 1 municipality against 225?

[[principles:Trust]]
[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[principles:Curiosity]]
[[principles:Self-awareness]]
Yeah\. Very good question\. Because what's different tools that I have to do first of all in the first tool is go and say, we have to work in this\. You are the citizens, you have the power, you have the all the knowledge because you are everyday working in you\. You are the only people to know your own problems and start them\. And we have like a lot of workshops, training, digital trainings and everything\. We, we create trust in the people, the cities\. And they say, OK, this is something like we never do\. This is something like we want to go farther with that\. Then in the second level, the municipality, I have another\. Yeah, it's very difficult because you have to go to convince, you know, it's like we were saying the theater that you have to go there and say, look, this is a platform, it's working\. We have right now these people and I did like 2 presentation for the technical people that how was the working of that, but also for the secretaries and the people that is working this\. We went there and with another presentation to say this is the value that you can have because the experiment, it can be like for the people to the city sense the municipality have kind of have another approach more of course more politician, but we change in that way\. And for the 25 was more easy because we put it everybody together to say, look, this is the platform is working right now\. We have like 5 or 10 neighborhoods working in this\. You have to be part of this and then you start thinking about Oh yeah\. And the design of the mythology of the process that we were with the citizen plans is that was to everybody have something in this platform like the city sense was like the people first people that is working\. But the municipality put it something more\. And we have like this corporation with everybody to say how we can of a huge platform, city citizen platform\. And that was the deal\. The like the first one is trust for the citizen\. That is the people, the problems\. Then the municipality is more than you try to sell like diagrams\. That why is important is for the not for the people, for the municipality and they can have these planning and impact from them\. And the third one is more easy, like you can do one percentage say, OK, we have this support the people is there, this is working\. Come on\.


And the people and also the academic was in private sector trying to say, oh, I like this platform, Diego, maybe I can go in and it's like, of course, come here and we can start working that\.

### [[13:10]] Can you walk me through the platform if I were the poor people in the community if I use the platform or is it the app, right?

Yeah, yeah\.

### [[13:19]] What does it look like if I OK download it and what am I going to do? How you search?

Yeah, yeah, yeah\. This is nice because we have like it's not that it's a personal because the neighborhood in the Paz, you have different things and the neighborhood is one neighborhood is not the same to the other ones, for example, will have more tourist\. The other ones have more, for example, they have more, I don't know, tourism\. The other stadium, the other half another quality things and I'll have all the gastronomy area\.

### [[13:57]] The idea is to each neighborhood in this platform is like it's, it's from for they own and they have the characteristic that they need it\.

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[principles:Curiosity]]
[[tactics:Share your value upfront]]
[[principles:Inclusivity and diversity]]
No, for example, in the area with the stadium, the data is different to the other because they want to have another\. For example, how they can have a parking, how they can have restaurants to see the behavior for the people when they go to the stadium\. That's different\. They say, do we need these to have this plan for the other one? We have this the gastronomy area\. They say no, I want, I don't care about the people right now\. I only want to have these\. For example, was very nice because he told me I want to have a map of the restaurant, for example to the hours of attending the food and everything that we have because we are doing a route of gastronomy that that is different and each neighborhood have a different information\. And you can, if you are a citizen and you want to go eat something to one place, you can eat to the area and say, I want to go to this neighborhood, for example, Mayasa, and you can put there and they have the information that you want to have in another places\. They have more technical stores, for example, like car stores, like I don't know how it's in English request stores, but for something like you need for your car\. And they have a lot of the streets selling things and if you want something of your car, you can put it the area and then you can go there because all the city is different\. They have another issue\.


### [[15:43]] Wow, that's very good\. Lead to the next interesting question because it's very diverse of the information\. It's a variety of the things\. So it's about tools\. So you so your image\. Wow\. OK, I think I have to OK boy, down to the last session\. Yeah Was anything you would like to say good yeah we yeah, we was talking with everything yeah\. Because I'm working on the data yeah how you deal with the data\. I seem to be variety of it and how you from the beginning, how you collect a lot of data, but how you process and how you use it\.

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[tools:GIS systems]]
[[principles:Accessibility of knowledge]]
[[tools:How might we]]
Yeah, that's a very good question\. We put it, we have this one academic area with university\. They are we like as a retail lab, we are working in the, in the, in the knowledge and the capacitation about how you can take the, the tools and the, the data and the academic process and the municipality take the information\. And now we, we are working in a nice project because we, for this, not only this project, like I think it's like 4 project we did with this municipality\. We are doing now this open data it's manual or over the plan for the municipality to take this data to reserve to have all the in the law\. But The thing is like the data is with the municipality because they have all these close things that they are under the near the university transfer to the to the municipality\.


### [[17:44]] OK, final question, yes, what is the next step for this project?

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[principles:Recognize and promote agency]]
[[principles:Accessibility of knowledge]]
[[principles:Always increase social capital]]
OK, it's yeah, this a very good question because now in two weeks another city that is bigger than La Paz is Santa Cruz called me and we have a meeting and they want to scale to say, Diego, we want this platform because we are looking that is very important\. And I say, OK, all the steps are done is it's not only to change logos, it's like more or less see and have this Co creation, but the platform is there and they will to start doing the same process and methodology\. Like is the city sense, the academic, the municipality\. That was the thing and looking forward to the scaling up of the project\.


### [[18:29]] Thank you for your time being\.

Oh, thank you very much\.

### [[18:39]] Yeah, sorry, sorry\.
