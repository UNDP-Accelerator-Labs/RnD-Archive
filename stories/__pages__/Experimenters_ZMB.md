# Experimenter\-Zambia\-Nampaka Ankumbula

### [[0:07]] So could you tell me about an R&D activity you would like to share with us?

[[tools:Design]]
[[tactics:Desiging the pipelines]]
[[principles:Curiosity]]
[[skills:Creativity]]
So I think my favorite R&D story currently is an ongoing experiment that we have been running since 2022\. And it's also I think in one of the hardest experiments that we've had to design and pull off and I'm looking forward to see what the results are\. We've been working in the development mineral space in trying to improve the productivity of artisanal and small scale miners, which is composed mainly of women small scale miners working on development minerals such as aggregate silica, non precious gemstones\. And we've been trying to find a way of supporting these businesses to improve or increase their incomes by either adding value to their products or improving their productivity\.


### [[1:14]] So what development issue are you trying to address by by this activity?

[[tactics:Asset mapping]]
[[principles:Always increase social capital]]
[[skills:Patnership]]
[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
So the artisanal small scale miners are usually informal\. They are women dominated entities and they attract very low incomes because of the nature of their work\. Because they're informal, it means that they don't have a land title\. It means that they cannot access any finance for them to be able to buy machinery required for them to extract and add value to their minerals\. And this means that they also attract very low prices on their materials or the goods that they are able to produce\. So basically they are in this vicious cycle where they are in business, but they are keep on attracting very low incomes in their businesses because they're unable to improve their productivity\. So let's talk about the stakeholders involved in this, in this, in this, in this, in this activity\.


### [[2:21]] Who,  which kind of stakeholders did you involve? And then what was the role?

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[tactics:Desiging the pipelines]]
[[tactics:Gaining leverage and traction for solutions]]
[[principles:Curiosity]]
So the first stakeholder of course is the artisanal small scale miners themselves\. And so the background is that in the country office we have a project called the the A/C P/E U development minerals project, which is the African, Caribbean and Pacific European Union development minerals project that has been running in the country office\. And they've been working with the artisanal small scale miners to help them formalise build their capacity for them to be able to build their businesses\. So through that project, they came knocking on the Accelerator Lab store and said we have these issues within our program\. The artisanal small scale miners want access to equipment, but you know, we don't know if they can afford it\. They're not formal\. How can Accelerator Lab come in, use your tools and methods to be able to surface what possible solutions that they could be\. And so we carried out the sense making or the community emission or the ethnography with the artisanal small scale miners to really understand what the issues were from their perspective, what were the barriers or what opportunities are available for them to be able to improve their productivity or even add value to their products\. And so I think these were our key stakeholders because they really helped frame what the challenge was\. And they also identified potential solutions that they felt were out there, but beyond their reach\. And the role of the Accelerator Lab in this case was to try and connect the dots and bring these things together\. We have a problem, a challenge, which is an opportunity for someone else within the sector\. And so the second stakeholder that we worked with are the innovators\. So the Accelerator Lab in Zambia has been working with the Ministry of Technology and Science in surfacing innovations across the country\. And so we have a repository of over 3000 innovations that we've surfaced, but we don't want to surface innovations and have them gather dust\. We always try to connect the doors to see how the innovations can be linked to the development challenges that we're hearing in our communities and in this case with the artisanal small scale miners\. And so we identified an innovator who had a solution, a stone crusher, a piece of equipment that could be used for by the artisanal small scale miners to improve their productivity\. And so we had to work as on another layer with the innovator to try and improve the prototype that he had so that it's something that could be tested induced by the artisanal small scale miners\. So the other stakeholders that we worked with, it's more like a chain effector\. The next layer then was academia\. We've been partnering with academia to support innovators to improve their prototypes\. And so we partnered with academia as well to support our innovator or startup to be able to improve the prototype and be ready for field testing\. We also worked with the Ministry of Mines and of course the UNDP project, the ACPE Development Minerals project\.


### [[5:45]] Thank you\. So I think in this you had some tools that you used\. So can you describe, briefly describe for us some tools and methods that you used for this particular?

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[principles:Trust]]
[[tools:GIS systems]]
[[principles:Human centering and adaptability]]
So for this activity, the first thing that we did was the sense making\. And so the tools they are definitely is you have to be able to listen to what's happening within the communities\. Usually I feel like as we go into communities, maybe communities of practice, maybe actual communities, we go with assumptions as to why things are working, why things are the way they are, and so really understanding from their perspective\. So this is I think, ethnographic tools or methods that are required for you to be able to understand from the perspective of the community what the issues, the barriers are, and also more importantly to try and understand from them what they feel the possible solutions could be\. Another tool or methods that definitely was required is the connection to academia\. So within the accelerator lab, not all the technical R&D \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* skills may be available\. And so we try to leverage our partnerships as much as possible to bring in these missing skills, for example, mentorship to the innovator so that they're able to produce a functional prototype\. The other two, I think that is required and we have to come back to that one\.


### [[7:15]] OK, thank you\. Thank you for that\. So maybe could you also let us know what are the ethical considerations of principles of inclusivity, equity or sustainability that guided your R&D?

[[skills:Patnership]]
[[tactics:Asset mapping]]
[[tools:Design]]
[[tactics:Desiging the pipelines]]
So I think when it comes to the principles of inclusivity, we the artisanal small scale mining sector is like I mentioned, dominated by women\. But then it's also very hard work\. And because it's dominated by women, you find that they're the ones who are extracting and maybe crushing the stones by hand, but they're not the ones who are making the most amount of money because they attract small amounts of money from their products\. The people who are really making money within the chain, within the value chain are the middle men\. So these are the transporters who come in, collect the goods and sell them at a higher price and because they have a higher bargaining power\. And so I think to ensure that there was inclusivity, we carried out collective intelligence workshops that brought all these players together\. We had the Ministry of Mines that is in charge of licensing and formalizing the artisanal small scale miners\. We also had some of the middle men transporters we brought into the collective intelligence workshop just so that we could hear from the all different perspectives of the players who were available, what the issues were and also for them to have an understanding of how their actions are impacting the group or the group of beneficiaries\. That's, you know, small scale miners whose incomes were being kept slow\. And so I think I don't have this answers the question on principles of whether I've really managed to bring out what the principle was\. But I think this is the method we use to ensure that there was inclusivity in the design of the experiment\.


### [[9:19]] Could you highlight some of the skills that were necessary?

[[principles:Curiosity]]
[[skills:Creativity]]
[[tools:Design thinking]]
[[tools:Collective intelligence for the analysis of emerging signals]]
So definitely we needed skills in ethnography to understand what's happening within the communities\. We also needed research skills on 2 levels\. So we needed to be able to design data collection questionnaires, survey tools to get the baseline from the artisanal small scale miners to understand what their productivity was before introducing the equipment\. And then also of course, the end line to understand what the impacts have been\. And then we also needed the engineering skills to support the innovator to develop their prototype\. You also need partnership skills to bring all these diverse players together in a way that is not, you know, in making sure that there's no conflict\. And so kind of ensuring that as you are designing the experiment, you're really keeping your partnership with stakeholder engagement at heart as well\.


### [[10:25]] What was what, what would you highlight as some of the impacts or outcomes of?

[[tools:Quasi expermental design processes]]
[[tools:A_B testing]]
[[tools:RCTs]]
[[tools:Pre-post-testing]]
I don't know whether because this is still ongoing, I don't know whether you really documented any impact\. So, so far we have developed the prototype and we have deployed the prototype with the Artesino small scale minors and it's currently undergoing testing\. So it's testing in two parts, OK\. We're testing to see what the impacts are with the Artesino Small Scale Minors, how the equipment improves occupational health and safety on sites and how it improves, you know, the women's experience from crushing stones manually now to using this machine\. How safe is it and is it really able to produce the products at the right type of quality required for them to hike their to ensure that the prices are increased and they're getting fair prices? On the other end, we're also testing a business model for our startup, the innovator who had brought who has made this equipment and made it available to the small scale miners for use\. And so we're testing to see as well there what is his business model\. Usually start\-ups sometimes come up with solutions not understanding what their business case is\. And so if we the question we're asking ourselves there is if he produces this piece of equipment and hands it over to the artisanal small scale miners in one area and potentially in future in other areas, how much does he needs to charge to be able to break even to make a profit\. And so we're also supporting the innovator there to actually develop his business case\. So in terms of impacts, what we expect to see is to have an understanding of what the impact of the use of the equipment has been on the productivity of the artisanal small scale miners and also what the business case or the business model is that the innovator would be able to use to scale the production of his product\.


### [[12:34]]  All right\. And maybe maybe lastly for my questions, what strategies or approaches would you employ? Would you employ maybe to facilitate adoption of, of, of, of this?

[[tools:Design]]
[[tactics:Desiging the pipelines]]
[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[tactics:Gaining leverage and traction for solutions]]
So we, we try, we saw because it's a actual product, right, that needs to be scaled and scale, meaning that it needs to have more sales\. So the strategy we're using is we want to generate evidence in this one area and through the network of artisanal small scale miners and other partners that we're engaging through the Ministry of Mines who have been working with many artisanal small scale miners across the country\. We have involved them within the process\. They have been part of the process from the beginning\. They were there during the sense making, they have been there during the prototyping, they are there during the field testing\. And so the process or strategy we're using is more like a Co creative process to ensure that the the partners or the potential scaling partners understand what the challenges are, have been with us through the journey\. And then we'll be able to best guide how we would be able to scale such an initiative to other areas\. We're also hoping from the positive impacts of the Artizano small scale miners with the piece of equipment that they're able, you know, to advertise to ensure that the word is getting out there\. We have equipment that can be made by a Zambian in Zambia for Zambians facing a challenge\. And so that's the strategy that we are employing\.


### [[14:12]] Thank you so much\. Thank you for your time and insights\.

### [[14:18]] Can I ask one more question?

### [[14:20]] Yes, have you had any success? And if so, what does that look like in embedding in UNDP?Probably talking here about your country office embedding experiments, embedding ways of working\.

If not, I think there's one nice example I like to use\. Not really within the country office, but with the government partner\.  

### [[14:45]] It's not UNDP\.

[[tools:Working with ecosystems]]
[[tactics:Getting in there]]
[[tactics:Beyond borders]]
[[tools:Design]]
No, it's with the government partner\. Embedding within UNDP would be this experiment, because this experiment came, this experiment was started by the program\. They wanted to find new ways of working to improve the livelihoods of artisanal small scale miners\. And so we experimented within the framework of the program\. The Accelerator Lab was responsible for bringing in the methods this community immersion, the collective intelligence workshops and bringing in our academic partners to be able to produce prototypes and the innovator to be able to provide a solution for the artisanal small scale miners\. So we experimented within the framework of the project within UNDP\.
