# Solutions Mapper\-Panama\-Anibal Cardenas

### [[0:02]] Hello, Anibal, please can you introduce yourself?

My name is Anibal Cardenas, I'm head of Solutions mapping at Panama Accelerator Lab\.

### [[0:14]] OK, do you consent to make with this video?

Yes I do\.

### [[0:20]] OK, could you give R&D story that you wish to share a title like a short descriptive sentence\.

The title it's a building a network for action to accelerate change in circular economy in Panama\.

### [[0:42]] OK, tell me about your RND journey\. Where did it start?

[[principles:Curiosity]]
[[tactics:Share your value upfront]]

[[tactics:Gaining leverage and traction for solutions]]
It started in 2020 in the middle of the pandemic\. We had a lot of mobility restrictions due to COVID\-19 and I started going to this rural area because there was the need of a project to design a solid waste management model to prevent the pollution of the marine and coastal communities in this region of Panama\. So I decided to move there for about 3 months to spend some time in the community and begin this journey of learning at that, you know, region of Panama\. And it was a very thing, inspiring moment\.


### [[1:38]] OK, for me\. Thank you\. Anibal, what tools and method did you use to do what you just described? Why?

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[tools:GIS systems]]
[[principles:Curiosity]]
[[tools:Design]]
Well, I think the first one was a participant observation\. We were just discussing this in one of the sessions today about that\. Maybe one of the principles in our work is let's not organize a workshop right away and start bringing people together without maybe having a time to really observe what's happening in that community\. How are people responding to the problems? What are these unusual suspects that we identify and how can we, through this observation, see how the problems affect different people in different ways and through that then start thinking on how we can create links\. But I think two things that are very important are methods that were important when I began this journey, was a participant observation and deep listening\. Because it's really important to listen before you even try to propose something, you know, to get a sense of what's really happening and how people are feeling the reality\.


### [[3:00]] OK, what source or material did you adapt or develop yourself? 

[[tactics:Systems thinking]]
[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[tools:Design]]
[[principles:Curiosity]]
And I think one of them was and maybe I did this before, but as part of the lapse, I think it's this idea of the elevator\. You know, we need to work very grassroots and at the same time see how we can elevate these insights, these learnings, these solutions to articulate that with the broader ecosystem and with policy in particular\. You know we have a lot of work that relates to policy\. And when we see that we have this vast, you know, landscape of solutions of people doing things, there's an opportunity to kind of elevate that to policy\. And even we find that policies sometimes need to be adjusted, adjusted to the realities of people or things that people are doing informed policies that already exist or are in the process of being created\. So I think that elevator was something very important like learn how to how to do that\. It's something that I think through this R&D journey of I've learned and developed\.


### [[4:19]] OK\. Thank you\. What skill was essential during your journey? Why skill?

Yeah, thank you\. I don't know if I would call that a skill, but I think it is\. It also relates, I think, to values\. And it's having a lot of humility, OK, to acknowledge that there are things you don't know, that many things you don't know\. Probably there is more that you don't know\. Than you know, surely\. And to have that humility when you relate to people\.

### [[4:50]] OK What skill did you develop during your journey Skill\.

Yeah\. Skill that I developed\. Well, I think well I mentioned a bit the elevator\. No\. OK, I think that's yeah what I'm saying in that one\.

### [[5:12]] OK\. Did you experience any skills gap? What did you do, plug it?

What did I do? What?

### [[5:25]] Sorry, what did you do to plug it?

[[principles:Curiosity]]
[[tools:GIS systems]]
[[tools:Design]]
[[tactics:Systems thinking]]
Well, I would say there were many\. I think in terms of data, you know, I had a lot of experience working, you know, at the grassroots level\. But then in this elevator process also I think data becomes a link to policy as well\. So kind of how to make relations between these grassroots solutions and let's say more, you know, also sources of data that inform how these solutions are generating impact through that lens, especially thinking on the links we want to make to policy\. I think it's something that I also learned as part of the journey\.


### [[6:16]] Yeah\. OK\. Why did you have to pivot, change course, try out a new tactic to get things moving, get people on board, etcetera?

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[tools:Design]]
[[principles:Self-awareness]]
[[principles:Curiosity]]
I think sometimes you need to see where the energy is\. OK\. I feel like often we want to do things, you know, like we have this idea or there's this project that has these objectives\. But then you realize sometimes people have other objectives in communities or in a community of practice and you have to be able to adapt and see where the energy is, what's the most pressing need for actors, what mobilize them\. And sometimes we strategize around that because if you want to push forward your objectives but that's not what the where the ecosystem is moving, then you need to adapt and not the other way, you know\. Otherwise you lose traction and you don't move because you're going kind of against the energy you know that the ecosystem is creating\. When the informant makes a statement with a general value, like you should always ask grassroots innovator about how they work, is perceived in the community, this sound like a general principle for you\. Is that correct? Why is why is that? Well, I think, I think a principle for me is working where the energy is, you know, where the energy of the ecosystem of communities are\. I would say that's the one I will highlight the most and it's important for me because that's what I've seen\. You know when you see how people are responding to a problem, when you see how they are responding to it and how they are relating to the overall community due to this, you know, pressing challenges, then you know you can connect things\. But if you don't see that energy or why or what mobilizes people and communities, then then you might be doing something that is kind of off and and and probably you know with very little impact because it's not connecting with people's realities\.


### [[8:44]] OK\. What was the actual development you showed that you were addressing and what did the situation look like?

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[principles:Curiosity]]
[[tools:GIS systems]]
[[tactics:Asset mapping]]
And the issue we're working on is a solid waste management and circular economy\. That's probably the area where me as a mapper have been the most involved in the country office and it's a massive problem in the country\. We have even from the city scale to the rural areas, a lack of, you know, a provision of basic services in terms of, you know, the solar management from collection to a final disposal\. But what we are seeing also is that even though in all of the indicators of multidimensional poverty and, you know, analysis that have been done, that's one of the top three priorities of almost every community in Panama\. And there is this idea that there's nothing happening, that things are getting worse\. But there's also an overlook of we are missing sight of everything that is also happening with many solutions, actors trying to play a role\. So you have this dichotomy of, you know people saying that nothing is happening and at this and the problem is getting worse\. But at the same time through the solutions mapping process, we identified that there is a lot happening, that there is a lot of people with willingness to change things\. But we have to come together and create these networks that will enable change in different scales\. That's the core of what we were doing\.


### [[10:26]] Yes, thank you Anibal, who was involved in your, in your journey, what was the rules and well it's we basically did different layers\.

[[skills:Creativity]]
[[tactics:Asset mapping]]
[[principles:Curiosity]]
[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
No\. We always as a lab in Panama say that we work always through a hyper local approach\. So even though we work at problems that you know might have a national scale, we always work through specific cases of communities\. So in the case of Panama for example, we work in public markets in solid waste and then in the neighborhood of Santa Ana, which is right at the heart of Panama City\. And then we also work in rural areas, in a rural municipality, in a rural community of Tonosi and through these examples then you're able to show the dynamics, the, the relationships, the missing links, you know across different actors and across different levels of the ecosystem\. And I think that's something that for us is key, you know, so you want to work obviously with the policy makers, you want to work with private sector, you want to work with academia\. But at the end who is this relevant to do you know who is really being impacted by that bad solid waste management system? You know it's people at the end\. So that's always at the core of what we do\. But obviously we always try to integrate, but always integrate in a specific case that has, you know, a real connection to people's reality\.


### [[11:57]] OK, how did you work with them? What did you do or share together?

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[tactics:Gaining leverage and traction for solutions]]
[[principles:Human centering and adaptability]]
[[principles:Recognize and promote agency]]
So one of the things that we do it so as part of the of the journey and as I shared at the beginning it was participant observation and deep listening\. So it was a lot of walking around their communities, having informal conversations with people, spending time with some of them and then through that identifying the kind of different perspectives that different actors could have in an in this case in this municipality of Tonosi\. And then after understanding a bit this, you know how they are relating to the problem, what they are doing, what solutions they are creating or what pressing needs they have\. Then we started to create collective intelligence spaces to design municipal solid waste management plan\. And then we prioritize key actions with the different actors and the things that were already happening in the territory to start developing some experiments and pilots to see if we could improve solid waste management or not\. And that included, for example, doing citizen science\. They already knew the effects that they had, for example\. But when we were working with the municipality, they said, yeah, that's happening\. But we don't have the data, we don't have the evidence\.


### [[13:28]] So these stories were also transforming to data, so that could also be taken or seen as valid knowledge by actors that needed that data\.

No\. And then through that then we developed experiments to try to improve you know solid waste management in the communities and it's a longer story\. I know probably we don't have enough time\.

### [[13:49]] What your, what opportunities did you see and how did you come to see them in in what regard, sorry, what opportunity did you see and how did you come to see them in your solution mapping?

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[tools:GIS systems]]
[[tools:Design]]
[[tactics:Asset mapping]]
Well, so partly it's through the journey that I described\. And I think the other kind of strategy we use was to do a mapping of mappings\. So we realized, for example, that there were many previous mappings that were done\. And so we already had a sort of landscape of who was doing what\. And so the idea was to do some sort of sense making on who was working, for example on recycling or in reducing or reusing or repairing and then to work on these different kind of communities of practice\. And bringing them together to share their solutions\. And also one of the things for example is what solutions are relevant to let's say policies that are being created in the country around a plastic pollution\. So, for example, we're working on a national strategy for plastics and we're all with the Ministry of Health, but we're also working on a National Plastics Action Partnership with the Word Economic Forum\. And the idea was to invite then the community of practice that is working on plastics to try to showcase these solutions and see how they are already responding to the policies that are being created or how the policies need to be adjusted so that a plastic circularity can be enabled in Panama\. And the solutions already had, you know, a lot of learnings on how policies are working or not working at what needs to be adjusted to really create a circularity of plastics in in Panama\.


### [[15:45]] OK\. How did or will your work impact sustainable development and what was the outcome of your R&D journey?

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[principles:Curiosity]]
[[tactics:Gaining leverage and traction for solutions]]
[[tools:GIS systems]]
I think one of the maybe main values I think even our country office sees is that we've been working with the ecosystem\. We started working with projects, but then we kind of broaden the approach to see the ecosystem at a more national level\. And for example, now that we have initiatives in the office so that there are new things that are being designed, what we're trying to do is to connect that with the needs of the ecosystem and not the other way around\. And I think in terms of R&D, we're working at the frontier\. No, we are kind of having the pulse on what's emerging, what new configurations of these solutions are being created naturally\. We cannot control what people do and no policy can do that\. No, no\. And the idea of improving the solid waste management system implies understanding how the system is behaving, how these solutions are emerging\. And I think as part of this R&D function that we have as a lab, that's something we have contributed in, in Panama for example, specifically for the issue of circularity and solid waste management\.


### [[17:08]] OK, thank you\. Anibal, what was a critical moment in your journey? Why? And was, was there a moment when things started to move, what catalyze this process?

I think a key moment was a working locally, this hyperlocal approach, and then people saying that's too small, you know you're working that it's too community based\.

### [[17:41]] So how is this relevant for the country?

[[tools:GIS systems]]
[[tools:Design]]
[[principles:Accessibility of knowledge]]
[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
No, we were\. We actually wrote a policy brief that was based on the case of this rural municipality\. And at the beginning people were like, what? How does that inform solid waste management at the country level? It's like the problems that we have nationally, the same dynamics or that very similar dynamics that happen at a local scale\. And sometimes people like to talk about the theories, but how does that look like in practice with people in real places? And I think when we started explaining what we learned with communities in this specific hyperlocal cases, it started making sense to people\. And then they wanted to replicate what we did at that local level, not so much in the results, but the approach, the observation, the deep listening, the collective intelligence, the experimentation\. They said that that we did at that hyperlocal level became relevant to start advancing key areas within the country office for example\. And I think you know that that related to solid waste management\. So I think that that's something that was I think a shift, you know, from thinking oh, this is too small to saying that same approach we did at this hyperlocal level is relevant to other areas of action\.


### [[19:05]] OK\. What would you do differently if you had to start again? Did anything that happening during the journey change your minds? Can you tell me more about how that happened? What assumption were proven wrong? How did you find out Something I will do different\.

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[principles:Self-awareness]]
[[principles:Flexibility and adaptability]]
[[principles:Human centering and adaptability]]
Now in retrospective, I will say sometimes go beyond this, something we discussed now thinking of the systems of the systems, I think observation and the listening gives you that\. But sometimes when you are too kind of encapsulated in A\-frame, let's say solid waste management, sometimes you might\. Limit the capacity to do all the things that relate to, you know, other areas of the problem\. And I think, yeah, sometimes it's, it's this balance we need to have between what we want to do, as I mentioned before, and what, you know, the brother system shows you\. And I think it's always something that is challenging because systems are complex and there are systems within systems within systems\. But you need to find let's say your scope and at the same time not lose sight of this\. And I feel that's something that I also keep\. Yeah\. And also I think to be more, I would say daring in sharing more of these hyper local learnings faster\. I think communicating things, it's really important communicating them through the voices of people\. And I think from the beginning we needed to work more on that like thinking how we want to communicate these stories with people in their own language to other people that share the same problems\. That's something we are learning later\. But I think at the beginning thinking of how we want to communicate this outside of those spaces through the voices of the people that lift these problems is something that I feel, yeah, I could have done differently before\.


### [[21:43]] OK, this is your last question\. How did you defuse policy, UNDP program or ecosystem is your last question\.

[[tools:GIS systems]]
[[principles:Curiosity]]
[[principles:Accessibility of knowledge]]
[[principles:Transparency and Honesty]]
Well, I think I answered that question a bit before\. I think it's a part of the elevator\. How do we kind of elevate these solutions, learnings, insights requires also the building throws and spaces within the country office and with other local governments and kind of decision makers\. And I think an example of that is that when we finish the solutions mapping process, this mapping of mappings that I refer to, we showcase that to every institution that has to do with solid waste management in Panama, Ministry of Health, Ministry of Environment, the National Waste Collection Authority, the Municipality of Panama, to see what we could see in the system\. And they were impressed\. They were like we didn't know there were this many solutions\. And then it's the process of engaging not just the solutions, but the insights, the context in which these solutions take place and how that can be recognized and included in the policies without losing their own identity and their own energy\. I think that's a learning we had and we don't have much time in this interview to speak more deeply about it\.


### [[23:03]] But thank you everybody\.

Thank you\.

### [[23:05]] Alright\.
