[[0:00]] My name is Nontobeko Mlangeni from Eswatini\. My R&D journey started back in 2019 when we joined the accelerator labs\.  We started with working with a group of not a group\. We started working with informal sector especially when COVID hit three months later after the lab was established in the country\. So we started working with the informal sector to try and find solutions for continuing, for allowing them to continue to work during COVID when they were shut downs\. So we worked on digital platforms to ensure that they continue business\. But later that in 2020, we started a new experiment called Patasako, which was trying to reduce the use of serious plastic bags and control those that went into in the environment because it had a lot of impact in terms of aesthetics, in terms of cause flooding in many parts of the cities\. It also affected the livelihoods of farmers, especially livestock who would eat this kettle\. So we went on a journey to say how can we reduce the plastic bags that go into the environment\. So we started the journey for me, started with me, and are taking ethnographic surveys to try and understand how consumers make decisions for which type of shopping back or career, but they're going to use when they go shopping\. So I went into the shops also to map solutions for what retailers were using to incentivize consumers to make certain decisions\. So it was an issue of observation, undertaking interviews with retailers, random interviews with consumers, as well as observing how shoppers just go around doing their business\. Once that was done with setup down with the lab defined an experiment based on those solutions\. We called all of the retailers\. We have 5 main retailers in the country that focus on food distribution\. So wanted to focus on that\. We called them and we told them, look, these are the solutions that we've mapped across your different brands\. So can we use the solutions to incentivize retailers and adapt them so that we to incentivize consumers so that they make certain choices about plastic bags? So unfortunately we're working with five different retailers whose head offices were based in Johannesburg, some in other countries, so they couldn't agree on one particular solution\. So we ended up sitting down to co\-create or co\-design a solution that would fit all of them\. The solution that came out and Taylor's agreed with was that of imposing a partial ban on the distribution of single use plastic bags\. So we agreed that for the first three days of the week, which was Friday, Saturday, Sundays, there would not be any distribution of single use plastic bags\. So unfortunately, fortunately or unfortunately, that was the busiest time of the year in terms of shopping\. It was December, everyone was doing Christmas shopping\. So it was the right time for us to try and test a tool or an experiment that would actually see what the impacts were because shop every shop powers in the mood for shopping, everyone had money for shopping\. So once the experiment was designed, we implemented it\. We implemented the partial ban\. And so we asked retailers to help us in terms of data collection, give us numbers for how many plastic bags they were distributing versus the plastic bags that were being distributed before the campaign started so that we're able to observe the change\. And in fact, we did observe that during the first two years of the experiment, there was actually a 60% reduction in the number of plastic bags that were being distributed into the environment\. We also worked with research assistants to help us also do social media mapping and surveys to see what the consumers were saying in terms of, you know, get uncensored data on what the consumers were feeling about this campaign\. We used that journalist to sort of understand the type of journey that a user goes through in terms of deciding that actually has an impact at the end of the shopping journey when they have to decide whether to take a plastic bag or not\. For instance, someone who decides in the office that I'm going to shop, I'm going to buy bread after work, probably won't bring a shopping bag\. But someone who sits down at home and says, no, I'm going to go shopping, I have a shopping list, probably will bring a shopping bag\. Someone will even forget I've forgotten it in that cut myself quite a number of times\. So those user journeys were important for us to understand what the targeting message should look like for someone who just does their shopping journey in the office, for someone who starts at home, for someone who you know, the different type of shoppers\. So we're able to target our messages correctly to say when are we going to remind someone worked with artists, comedians, to develop content for us to put on social media platforms, to put on radio in the morning for someone whom you're going to work\. Please remember to bring your own shopping bag because our campaign was mostly about saying people must bring their own shopping bags so that they don't have to get a plastic bag\. Remember, our plastic bags distribution in the country has been free\. So you can imagine if you are buying three things, you'd find three things being put in three different bags because this one is sunlight for washing\. This one is meat, this one is what? So we're trying to reduce that\.


### [[5:34]] Yeah\. Thank you very much\. You've mentioned the user journey\. I mean you've given why it's important, but maybe just to get a sense from your experience on using the user journey, how did you find it useful in the context that you were using and what skills did you require to kind of get it implemented successfully?

[[principles:Time management and adaptability]]

OK\. In terms of say, user gene, I think it was really useful for us to understand because when we started the experiment, there were a lot of assumptions that we're making\. Most of the design, the core design was done between US and retailers\. We hadn't brought in any consumers to come into the space to say, is this even going to be suitable for you\. So the consumer using those user genes was helpful in helping us understand consumers themselves, how they make decisions about whether or not to take a plastic bag at the tail\. Some of them it's something that don't doesn't even come to their minds when they are leaving home\. It for you even as well doesn't come to your mind when you're leaving the office to say I'll need a plastic bag when I do\. You only remember when you're at the tail\. So it was meant to help us understand and it did help us and did understand why a shopper makes a certain decision whether or not to say to the shop till no I, I'll carry my bread with my hand or no, I'll bring a shopping bag\. Because it helped us then to design targeted messages that would help us ensure that someone didn't bring a shopping bag\. In terms of skills, but maybe just for the entire assignment, I think we were trying to facilitate a transition from for a behavioral change for consumers\. Our consumers were used to not thinking about carrier bags when they were going shopping\. So we wanted them to start now saying what am I going to carry my shopping with? So we wanted that process to start back at home\. So we didn't unfortunately have the skills, especially in the lab to facilitate that behavior change\. We just assumed because we had done this, we had, we had forced people to not have to not have access to a plastic bag because of that partial ban that happened over the three days of the week\. We assumed that people would actually remember to bring their shopping bags, but not that wasn't the case\. And for the longest time that experiment was meant to run for three months\. It ended up taking a whole two years because it upscaled naturally and maybe we'll talk to the upscaling later\. But in terms of skills, we found that we had to learn some skills about behavioral insights and we did had support from one of the periods in the in UNDP to support us in terms of what tools can we use and what methods can we use to understand and to help facilitate the process of behavioral change\. So we did have that challenge in terms of behavioral insight\. We had to learn that skill\. Indeed with the user journeys, we also had to learn how to study a user journey\. So those are some of the gaps that we had in terms of this experiment in terms of looking at how to get people on board\.


### [[8:46]] Was there any specific approach or way you used to make sure that people were on board to part to be part of the user journey?

[[principles:Human centering and adaptability]]
[[tactics:Agreeing to a tangible commitment]]

[[tactics:Play do not preach]]
Yes\. In fact, in terms of getting people on board, I think the most important part was the issue of communicate communication, bringing in targeted messages\. Because the first day, unfortunately, we just stopped distributing plastic bags\. So people had that shock to say what's happening, why am I not getting a plastic bag when I'm doing my shopping? So we had to then develop targeted message\. We had burners for all of the shops that were participating at the front end of the store, just when you're about to enter, we would find a reminder to say, have you remembered to bring your shopping bag today? We had work with artists to say, can they develop content for us in a comedic manner to say can people just remember, can this be a fun activity instead of people just being angry at the tail\. So I think the most important key part of this was undertaking well targeted messages to ensure that people do in fact remember\. We worked with retailers\. Some retailers have radios within their shops, so we used those facilities and those TV's to say to make those public reminders\. Yeah, I've identified a few number of stakeholders that were involved\.


### [[10:12]] You've mentioned actors, you've mentioned the retailers and the people who trained you in the user journey\. Are there any other stakeholders that you worked with and how were they involved?

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[principles:Curiosity]]
[[principles:Inclusivity and diversity]]
[[principles:Diversity]]
Yes, we had quite a few key stakeholders\. Yes, you've mentioned the retailers, you've mentioned the consumers, which initially were not part of our thinking, although they were the target\. We didn't think really they were our stakeholders, but we also had key stakeholders like the environment authority and government, the Minister of Tourism and Environmental Affairs, and those were the key critical stakeholders in terms of US saying can we in terms of upscaling and diffusion\. And because with them in the design effects, EEA environmental authority was very key in the design of the experiment\. So, it became easier when the experiment was going on to say how do we leverage on the achievements of this experiment to facilitate for a policy that would ensure that this experiment is actually sustainable\. So, government and EEA were able to facilitate for the passing and implementation of the plastic back regulations for the first time in the country\. And in terms of impact, this key stakeholders were important because they help well including retailers, they were able to provide the platform\. For instance, for other groups like we had a group of over 120 women who started producing reusable shopping bags for the experiment we had\. So in terms of impact, we had those women have new livelihoods, which also was useful in terms of the diffusion of the experiment, of the results of the experiments and it's uptake because there were those visible impacts that people were seeing in terms of learnings\. Maybe let me come in there in terms of how the partners were also useful for us because one of the key learnings that we had with this experiment, one of the key lessons that we have with this experiment was that plastic, even though the campaign resulted in the reduction in the distribution of single use plastic bags, consumers were still willing to pay for the more expensive reusable shopping bags and that's number of shopping bags that were sold throughout the two years\. We had assumed it would go down, but unfortunately it didn't because we saw it going up, which told us that actually our people, people are willing to pay more, meaning polluter pays principle would not be effective principle like a levy would not be effective in terms of resources and single use plastic bags because clearly people are willing to pay\. Also what we learn to us that during the height of height of the experiment, we should have immediately come up with legislation that supported that experiment\. Because what we found at the end, especially with what's happening now in the country, the Partasakh on our campaign, the actual partial ban on single use plastic bags was more effective in reducing the number of single use plastic bags that go into the environment than the actual current regulations that impose a levy\. So now there are more plastic bags being distributed than when there was the partial circle with the partial pen\. So maybe if we had come with that legislation at that time that specifically targeted that I think would have won the fight against plastic bags\.


### [[13:40]] Has it been taken up by the UNDP? 

[[tactics:Getting in there]]
[[tools:8 Elements (or Steps) for Policy Innovation]]
[[tactics:Gaining leverage and traction for solutions]]
[[principles:Accessibility of knowledge]]
Actually yes, the plastic bag campaign in a swatting resulted in UNDP actually starting work on singing this plastic bags\. We had the SGP small grants program funding as to the tune of 200,000 U\.S\. dollars to implement the plastic initiative\. We also did resource mobilization for a wasteful livelihood project that was funded to the tune of 600 thousand U\.S\. dollars\. And that's a small, that's big money for a small country like ours\. So yes, it helped\. It was upscaled within UNDP, but it was also upscaled outside because even other retailers were not part of the initial 5 retailers\. Actually, all retailers in the country now participated in the PASSA second hour campaign voluntarily\. So that's why I was saying maybe had we put in a legislation that supported that, the campaign would have been more successful, sustainable\.


### [[14:38]] Thank you very much\.

Yes\. Then I try observing\.
