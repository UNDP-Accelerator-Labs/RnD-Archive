# Explorer\-Somalia\- Hadan Ahmed Abdullahi

### [[0:02]] Hi, Hadan, could you please tell me your name and position?

My name is Hadan Ahmed Abdullahi\.I'm the Head of Exploration in Accelerator Lab Somalia\.

### [[0:13]] Great\. And could you tell me about an R&D activity that you would like to share?

[[tools:GIS systems]]
[[principles:Curiosity]]
[[skills:Data management]]
[[skills:Pitching skill]]
I'd like to share the a very special R&D pilot that we did a few years ago and we just finished last year, which is the positive deviance pilot, the data powered positive deviance pilot\. And it's very special to me because of the its focus on finding healthy range lands and the especially because that was an indicator to show us where communities that were more or less resilient to droughts were actually situated\. So we should I go to\. So the idea is that the idea was to use big data, of course, analyze that data and then from, especially during, how do you say it, it's over a long of time, from 20, if I remember correctly, 2015 all the way until 2020 where we were focusing on a catastrophic event that happened in the middle around 2017, there was a a catastrophic drought that happened\. So we studied all of that, that data, analyzed all of that data to find communities that were resilient\. So we studied before the drought, during and after, and we found around several communities that were positively deviant, which showed that they had maintained their environments throughout\. And then we what we did is we went to these areas just to see what is it that they were doing differently than other communities that were not resilient\.


### [[2:16]] Amazing\. Hodan, What was specifically the development issue that you were addressing?

[[principles:Curiosity]]
[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[principles:Flexibility and adaptability]]
[[tools:GIS systems]]
The development issue it, it's actually a multifaceted issue that we were trying to focus on which was resilience to drought, OK\. And while we were working on this, we realized it's not just droughts, but there are several, several climate crisis that come together and exacerbate the effect of a drought\. So you have urban, you know, lifestyle of people that is changing from pastoral to to urban land that is being utilized instead of it being open for people to use and range lands and environment to be protected, that land is being cut up and being used for private usage\. And that gives us another facet, which is the the conflict that that come come out of that\. And then you have the scarcity of water\. That's another issue that also makes this whole system, this whole ecosystem very fragile\.


### [[3:39]]  Great\. And in terms of research and development, what were the tools and methods that you used for this project?

[[tools:GIS systems]]
[[skills:Communication skills]]
[[tools:Design]]
[[principles:Accessibility of knowledge]]
The tools that we've used were mostly data, analytical data, especially big data, satellite imagery and analysis of that data, in addition to, of course, coupling that with other forms of data like police station positions, urban areas, proximity to urban areas, so that we would get a more richer understanding of the communities on the ground before we went and we did our visits\. So that was one\. Another tool that we used was the qualitative analysis\. We used storytelling as another tool where not only did we use storytelling to capture data, very rich video and audio data from the communities that we visited, but we also use this as a way to defuse that, you know, the stories that we got so that people understand the whole problem that we're trying to solve\.


### [[4:55]] Great\. And could you tell me the principles that guided these R&D work?

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[principles:Accessibility of knowledge]]
[[tools:GIS systems]]
[[principles:Flexibility and adaptability]]
The principles are basically flexibility\. We were very flexible in terms of defining the framework for the research itself, going through different, for example, different data sources, proxy data, especially within area like Somalia where we have a huge gap in terms of documented data and even data sharing is not a very, it's not an option\. Actually another thing is that we are very flexible in terms of doing the qualitative analysis\. We, we tried several visits to the areas in addition to you could say even engagement with the communities, we tried different engagement methodologies\. Another thing is even dealing with the government, we're very flexible because when you're, you have some kind of a, a, a very complex problem like the one that we were solving, people already assume or in, in our case, in our context, people assume that they know what is going on and that they know the solution\. And it's a very single point solution\. It's not a very complex system of of tactics and strategies that communities have developed on the ground\. So there was a big gap between what was what it was actually happening on the ground and what our officials thought that they knew\.


### [[6:47]]  Very interesting\. Thanks, Hodan\. And in terms of skills, what will you say were the skills that you needed to effectively identify and understand this challenge?

OK, I think resilience, OK\. I'm being very adaptable and keeping a very open mind when it comes to dealing with the problem that is not very much well defined and it has different, different dimensions\. Social dimension, you have the climate dimension, you have the dimension of analytics and and the data you have the whole social effects\. All of that stuff\. You need to be very flexible and open minded\. Other than that, I think systems thinking was a very big one\.

### [[7:46]] Great, huge skill that was very important\. Great\. Thank you\. And in terms of tactics and approaches that you use to engage with stakeholders, can you tell me a bit of that?

[[tactics:Undertanding the community]]
[[tools:Conducting interviews]]
[[tactics:Getting in there]]
[[principles:Deep listening to map beyond the intangible]]
Well, a lot of the tactics that we've used mostly it give me a second to remember\. Sure, OK\. We used a lot of semi structured interviews in addition to the methodology for positive deviance interviews\. So these are two of the main things that we've used\. Another thing that was very important was observation, just going to the community, not only having the interviews and the focus group discussions and just detailed interviews with, with key interesting people within the community, but we also observed the areas and we told them and we asked them very, very humbly to to take us around the community just to see things and how, how, for example, they were storing their harvest\. How they were preparing for a drought\. What is it that they were actually doing? They were very humble and they gave us a lot of input and they took us all around just to see\.


### [[9:22]] That's very nice\. Is there something that I'm missing that I haven't asked about the research and development process?

[[principles:Curiosity]]
[[tactics:Getting in there]]
[[tactics:Desiging the pipelines]]
[[principles:Collaboration]]
Well, it's it\. OK, One thing\. That was a big one thing\. There was a a big challenge and it took some time actually not 1\-2 The first one was trying to create data partnerships, data sharing partnerships with telecom companies, which is which, which was a big opportunity\. If done, if, if it was possible at the time, it would have had a huge impact on on that the date, the IT would have had a huge impact on the results that we have\. We might have had better understanding\. So that was one that was a bit maybe it was, it wasn't the right time\. There was no data protection laws\. Government wasn't even looking at it very much and the private sector is not so open to sharing their data\. Another thing that was a bit interesting in terms of research and development was finding the indicators\. So defining the indicators\. And this one, it was the one of the biggest issues that we had\. But then again, when we reached out to the whole community, we, we sent a tweet, one of the team members sent a tweet asking for help on how is it that we can identify communities that are resilient? What indicator should we use when we have only satellite imagery? And the interesting thing is a lot of academician, academic academics from different institutions reached out\. All wanted to help to solve this problem\. And they gave us a lot of interesting input\.


### [[11:25]] That's very nice\. And now reflecting on your journey\. While what we say was the impact or the outcomes of this project, the outcomes is, and I'm, I'm even surprised by the outcomes that we are, we found communities and, and it and it was very surprising throughout the process because we went with assumptions when we're going to map out the solutions of the strategies that the communities came up with\.

[[principles:Curiosity]]
[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[principles:Inclusivity and diversity]]
[[principles:Diversity]]
And then when we wanted to go and do an experiment to see if we can take those strategies, solutions, etcetera, to another community, that was not positive\. We got different insights\. So for if I go into detail into the first one, for example, the solutions that they had was, for example, they had areas that were communal for or communal rangelands\. They put together storage facilities for their feed for the animals just in case of droughts\. They had a lot of water harvesting facilities\. And then again, an interesting thing that they had is they actually created their own organic pesticides, for example, and they were very much aware of how, for example, chemical pesticides affect their affect their farms, affect their animals, etcetera, etcetera\. There was that high awareness\. And then again, they were very much open to experiment\. So they tried different different herbs, different things until they reached a point where they were And then when we did the experiment, we realized that all of that wouldn't have been possible without the community being having a certain governance within itself and a self organization that made all of that possible\. So that was another insight that was very interesting, very nice\.


### [[13:31]] Can you tell me about what strategies or approaches that you employed to facilitate the diffusion and adoption of this R&D outcome and maybe we could start if you think it has been adopted by someone else?  
Well, what we used is basically we use the conventional\. We did a workshop where we invited a lot of the government officials from academia\. Our RR was and DRR were present and we did this whole media exposure for the pilot\. Well, that one was kind of an effort\. It didn't give us that much of A traction\. But now what we're trying to do is, you know, taking a more grassroots approach, you know, going to academia ourselves and presenting what we have, going to people on the ground like people, other communities, telling them about it, and then hoping hopefully from one to the other it goes organically\.

### [[14:41]] Great\.Thanks, Hodan\. This has been amazing\. Thanks for sharing\.

Thank you\.
