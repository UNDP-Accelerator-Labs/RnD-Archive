# Experimenter\-Serbia\-Kristina Nikolic

### [[0:05]] OK\. So tell me please your name, your title and say I consent to this recording\.

My name is Christina Nikolich\. I'm head of experimentation at UNDP Accelerator Lab in Serbia\. And you can use this recording for your purposes, comps purposes\.

### [[0:30]] OK, over to you for the first question\.

### [[0:32]] All right\. So can you tell us about the R&D activity that you would like to share, how did it come about and where did it start?

OK\. So the R&D activity that I would like to share with you today is around user journey mapping activity\. Basically, we wanted to explore career paths of women in ICT sector in Serbia using user journey maps\. This was the activity part of a broader, new, broader\.

### [[1:10]] OK, let's start from the beginning\.

[[tools:User journey mapping]]
[[skills:Information management]]
[[tools:Facilitation skills]]
[[tools:Futures and Foresight]]
So the R&D activity that I'd like to share with you today is around user journey mapping\. We wanted to explore career paths of women in ICT sector in Serbia and this R&D activity is part of a larger initiative in Serbia\. We are dealing for the last couple of years with the topic of women in Stems\. So this activity helped us to better understand the current state of women in this sector\. So basically that's it\. We were using user journey mapping as a tool, as a method to identify main obstacles, main positive but also a negative aspects of career paths and how basically women are advancing their career and working\. We as a UNDP and Accelerator Lab intervene together with our different stakeholders\.


### [[2:06]] What was the development issue that you were addressing?

[[principles:Human centering and adaptability]]
[[principles:Always increase social capital]]
[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[principles:Inclusivity and diversity]]
Yeah, well the main development issue that we were addressing here was under representation of women in ICT sectors\. So despite the large proportion of women in ICT sector in Serbia, when you compare it to for example, EU or other countries in the regions in Serbia, we are like 32% and E and EU is around 25%\. So we are, we are OK\. But when you dig further in the into the data, you see that they are not occupying managerial and senior positions within those positions or careers that they're, they're in\. So we wanted to see the reasons and the, the, the low representation of women in in, in this sector are very important and growing sector is the importance of having people having women in, in this sector is important\. It's not only that it's a fact on the individual level, but also on in a broader size, meaning that it can leads directly to technological biases, meaning that we are not producing, we're not creating, developing technology that are so in line with needs of half most population women\. Also we see that we can miss so much talent, so much potential, so many innovative potentials for innovation to be built\. Basically in a broader sense, a low representation of women in ICT sector can also lead to it can basically fuel fuels economic disparities\. It can widen, although the existing digital divide, it can reduce possibility for role models for future generations and also it can straighten, it can further maintain over the existing politics\. So for us, it was a big issue and we wanted to explore how can UNDP together with stakeholders provide some answers and, and give some answers and concrete actions that we can work together\.


### [[4:35]] And what tools methods you used in this journey and why did you use those?

[[tools:GIS systems]]
[[tools:Conducting interviews]]
[[tactics:Getting in there]]
[[skills:Communication skills]]
So the main tool that we've been using through this R&D activity was user journey mapping\. Basically it's a way of working and collecting a large amount of qualitative data\. So sometimes, especially when you're dealing with such a topics as this is you have plenty of official traditional statistics, traditional data and sometimes these you, you, you can easily miss those things that are very important in, in making decisions\. So we decided to have an interview sessions with a group with more than 30 women with different profiles in ICT sector\. And basically we use the recommendation list to find those women\. We were using women for the interview sessions that they're low key, meaning that they're not so high profile on and visible in a public eye, in a professional eye, but they're part of workforce\. And we had those in depth interviews trying to map and later visually represented their career paths, meaning that how everything started starting from their early childhood and education and everything that goes in those in that, in that particular stage, then elementary school, high school faculty, first job, changing the jobs career, that kind of career, career paths that way\. And basically user journey mapping helped us to not only synthesize and collect quality data, but also to later present that in a very easy to understand narratives\. So people can actually use can use that as a engagement tool, but also as a conversation starter\. We can say people, I mean our stakeholders, but also UNDP and also gave us a, a clear understanding where are the barriers\. This goes very well with a phenomenon called a leaky pipeline\. So if you imagine a career path, if a pipe that is leaking in many, many places\. So basically those places where the leakage is are places where women are dropping off from the career paths\. And we wanted to see where are those places, where are those places so that basically we can better understand the context of those places\.


### [[7:18]] Why?

And to use that knowledge to create, to do interventions and to act upon it\. So user journey mapping is a great tool if you want to combine traditional data with qualitative data collected in this way\. And we in lab really believe that through social innovation can be built around both traditional data only when you combine traditional data together with alternative data sources\. And in that way, you're basically creating evaluations, social innovation that can answer to needs of people\.

### [[7:58]] And can you elaborate on the principles that gathered your R&D work and why were they important principles?

[[principles:Trust]]
[[principles:Transparency and Honesty]]
[[principles:Prioritize transparency in methods and openness in sharing data and results]]
[[principles:Inclusivity]]
Well, bearing in mind that we are dealing with personal stories of many women, inclusivity and confidentiality were very important for us\. We got informed concerns from every individual participating in our interviews\. We were handling their sensitive information very carefully\. So basically all our principles were built upon trust and confidentiality because we want we\. We were aware how important it is to collect those stories, but also how fragile it could be if something bad happened\. Or we also kept anonymous the profile of those women\. So only the interviews, only those people who made those interviews with a woman, with women participating basically knew their name, last name and all the sensitive and personal data\. So I would say main principles were around that\.


### [[9:12]] And what skills would you say were needed to effectively identify and understand the challenges or needs that your R&D work team to address?

[[principles:Empathy]]
[[tools:Personas]]
[[tools:Design]]
[[tools:GIS systems]]
Well, in this case was all around analytical thinking, the ability to have empathy with participants and everything that goes with qualitative research\. But I would also say that for us, it was very important bearing in mind that we had more than 30 interviews, a good project management, meaning that to manage all the expectations and to have a good time management and to basically deliver what was promised\. And the third basket of skills I would say would go around effective communication, meaning that if we are building a communication tool and engagement tools, those visual represent these visual representation of user journey maps, effective communication would be a very important skill scene in all of this\.


### [[10:17]] So in terms of impact, what was the outcome of your in the journey?

[[tools:Conducting interviews]]
[[tools:GIS systems]]
[[tools:Design]]
[[tools:Citizen science and gamification using digital platform to crowdsource solutions]]
Well, the most of you, most of you obvious ones were the maps\. As I said, those were we collected through those interviews and we created different maps based on a different profiles of women in ICP sector\. And it was interesting to see how those quotes, for example, from the maps helped us to build a social media campaigns because basically we were using the same words that women were saying throughout the interviews for creating good tag lines for a campaign\. So I would say the main outcome of these activities were maps, but also some other products, products that were made out of maps such as blog post separate\. Well, we, we have designated a web page for all our research activity in the topic of women in STEM\. And basically this was the part of that web page newsletter\. But most importantly, we also organize the workshops based on usage in the math as a method\. We invited high school and and university students to get familiar with this methodology\. And we also invited some experts and some professionals and top leaders in these fields to help us with these workshops and to inspire those girls and women and basically to help them to if they could imagine their career paths, how that would look like and basically to share some experiences of those who acted as a as a mentors\. So I would say those were some of initial outcomes, initial products of our R&D activity\. And the idea is to have on the regular basis hese kind of workshops, workshops is engagement tool with our direct target group\.


### [[12:26]] With all of this, what strategies or approaches did you employ to facilitate discussions and adoption of your R&D outcome?

Could you repeat again?

[[12:38]] what strategies or approaches did you employ to facilitate the discussion and adaptation of your R&D outcome or is this the previous one?

That was the previous one I owed you\. OK\. Maybe the second one would be around the diffusion and catalyzation\. Yeah\.

### \[12:58]] So what strategies or approaches did you employ? how did you engage policy makers, private sector communities or other key actors to catalyze? There is some about question about the diffusion and catalyzation\.  
Yeah\. So the strategies around the diffusion and catalyzation, well, first of all, I would say that one of the one of the approaches that we had was around creating and having a digital sharing, creating those digital content through our blogs, newsletter, web page, digital accounts where we basically shared everything that we produced including those maps\. The second one was around the collaboration starting from collaborating with colleagues from country office\. Having in mind this is a cross office initiative, we are working together with our colleagues from the gender team, but also with colleagues from the digital team as well as COMS team\. And basically we are working All in all of this is a cross office team, cross office initiative\. So I would say approach was collaboration with colleagues from country office, but also with other stakeholders involved in all of this, starting from private sector companies, academia, basically all individuals and organisations who helped us to get to those women and to facilitate and to facilitate the discussion\. Secondly and also to help us to organise those workshops as well\. Second thing was, as I said this, they they react engagement through those workshops and the fourth one would be or 5th would be around social media campaigns\.  Having in mind if we have coms on board with with us in all of this, we were we were able to create digital content that was shared\. And currently there is one campaign around fatherhood and parenting\. And let me share that story with you\. Throughout our work on user journey maps, we saw 11 pattern that was very important and it popped out very easily throughout almost all interviews\. And that was how career of women changed in the time when she became became a parent, a mother\. So we understood that this segment should be explored further\. And we decided to hire some expert in this field to see whether we can produce some guides to better understand what can we do in the terms of balancing private life, family life with expectations and responsibility in the in the workplace\. And also to see not only to produce those guides, but also to see can we make a framework based on the inputs and insights that we collected\.  And currently we're working on our framework around balancing those very important roles that's one individual can have in, in, in, in the life\. And the plan is to test this framework in one small mid sized town in Serbia in Chachak during this year\. And this will be basically a a part of a large initiative of the portfolio of the population because somehow everything that we do is connected with the idea of maximizing human potential of people living here or abroad\. And this topic of having a fulfilled life in Serbia is basically connected to both of these topics\. So we will our plan is to test that in, in next couple of months\.

### [[16:59]] OK, that's it\.

Yeah\.
