# Building Community and Climate Resilience

### [[0:01]] Good morning Safa, how are you feeling?

Well, thank you\.

### [[0:06]] Maybe can you tell us a bit of you know your name and your, your positions and where you're from?

Sure\.  
My name is Safa\.  
I'm the Head of Exploration for the Acclab Iraq\.

### [[0:17]] That's perfect\. So today we would like just to to hear about your story related to R&D activity\. Maybe could you tell us then and one, you know, R&D activity please\.

Sure\.  
So today I'll talk about an initiative or a project that we are going through right now\.  
It's not finalized yet\.  
It's called SU Community and Climate Hub\.  
So specifically, this is a community and a climate hub that UNDP is\.  
Let's say that UNDP is\.  
I wouldn't say we are building, but I would say we are scaling an existing youth center to become a climate and a community hub for a district in one of the southern governorates in Iraq\.  
So the district is called\.
[[tools:From Insights to Impact:  Storytelling for Renewable Energy Solutions]]
[[tools:This guide provides an introduction to prototyping, explaining]]
[[tools:Innovation Challenge]]
[[tactics:Design the narrative flow and the stage to ensure the community and the desired outcome lead]]

### [[1:15]] So you already mentioned a bit that it's kind of like related to the previous project, right? Or you want to talk about just a little bit of where this this in this initiative start from?

[[tools:Increasing community engagement through community-growing incentives]]
[[tools:Scaling partnerships by demonstrating value incrementally]]
[[tools:Collaborative design of actions]]
[[tools:From Insights to Impact:  Storytelling for Renewable Energy Solutions]]
So specifically this initiative, it's basically the idea is that when we've done the portfolio approach for the Iraq country office, the portfolio that we constructed was focused on social contracts in Iraq\.  
And one of the main issues with social contracts in Iraq were like economic youth climate\.  
But one of the interventions we ideated is to kind of, let's say, laid the ground to tackle these issues collectively\.  
So that's why we started with a community hub in order to give people the space, the voice, in order to communicate, to share their opinion, but at the same time to support in tackling youth and employment in this district\.  
Because this district doesn't get a lot of government attention or get a lot of even actually international organizations attention\.  
So that was first\.  
Second, it's one of the districts that is really most affected by climate change because the southern part of Iraq is really affected by climate change and water scarcity and certification raising temperatures\.  
So that was the main reason that it's the portfolio approach, but also it's the need of this district and that let's say the attention\.  
Third, UNDP environment and energy team already\.  
So when we started like beginning of this year, already had the plans to actually start a project in the southern government and they wanted a base in these governor rights\.  
So we collaborated efforts in order to let's say we start the sensing and exploring and like collecting of insight for them\.  
So when their projects about biodiversity and marshland starts, we already have a base for them\.

### 3:24 OK, that's great\. That's all amazing\. I think you already really mentioned a lot already about the development issue, maybe just to recap\. So what was the development issue that you were addressing for this specifically?

[[tools:Prototyping of solar mobile kiosk for Youths and Women running small street businesses?]]
[[tactics:Understanding the Community]]
[[tools:Increasing community engagement through community-growing incentives]]
[[principles:Recognize and promote agency: Enable agency, the greatest choice for the greatest number]]
Development issue is climate change, but also social contract and youth unemployment within climate change we want to support and having like a smart farm in the in the community hub\.  
We want to support and having solar panels within the youth employment\.  
We want to like create a Co working space with like a lot of nice colors in order to support and giving space for the youth and the community actually as a whole to interact, to communicate, but also to build their schools and to find training and mentorship opportunities\.

### [[4:20]] That sounds great\. Excited about that\. So who are the stakeholders that was involved and what was their role in this case?

[[tactics:Understanding the Community]]
[[tools:Scaling partnerships by demonstrating value incrementally]]
[[principles:Collaboration]]
[[tools:Increasing community engagement through community-growing incentives]]
Awesome\.  
So the stakeholders, first of all is the Ministry of Youth and Sports through their youth center in the district\.  
So the youth center that now we are rehabilitating and supporting, it actually belongs to the Ministry of Youth and Sport\.  
So we already have that government partner\.  
Second, our partner is the local organization that we're working with\.  
It's a local organization that operates in Baghdad, but they have a vast network in the South\.  
It's called Bahalum Local Organization\.  
So our partners are these, but also we put the local community with us from the start\.  
I don't know if we wanna consider them partners\.  
Maybe they are beneficiaries also, but we are working very closely with six working groups\.

### [[5:18]] So from the local community, that's how awesome I think\. Yeah, local community is also I think very important partners here as well\.

[[tools:Innovative approach - Design Thinking - Issue Mapping - Stakeholder Mapping]]
[[tools:Systemic Design]]
[[principles:Collaboration]]
[[tactics:Share your value upfront, not budget]]
Yeah\.  
And how did the input shave your R&D journey?  
So basically we have the idea like end of last year, one of the interventions that came out of the portfolio approach is to start a community hub\.  
But we established the concept notes, we did our research, but then we started approaching local organizations that work in the South\.  
So we started exploring and talking with them\.  
And when we talked to this organization, the one that we are working with right now by the foundation, we were like what are the priority issues?  
You know, what is the geographical location that you want us to focus on?  
Because we have the whole governorate, the hard governorate\.  
So should we focus in the center?  
Should we focus in districts?  
Like we want to have the project here?  
Like what is the geographical location?  
So their input actually shaped the geographical location that we choose\.  
Yeah, the exact, let's say, facility for the community hub\.  
So they recommended to have this community hub and also the priority challenges that we want to focus on\.  
So which is we wanted to focus on community and climate change, but also they highlighted that youth unemployment is a priority\.  
So we incorporated this\.  
So their input actually shaped the final project, to be honest\.

### [[6:54]] Yeah, that's perfect\. And I know that's just very, you know, kind of like long journey and, and involve a lot of stakeholders as well\. So what tools and method that you use throughout this journey and, and why?

[[principles:Human centering and adaptability: Less of me, more of them]]
[[principles:Recognize and promote agency: Enable agency, the greatest choice for the greatest number]]
[[principles:Recognize local expertise /Knowledge is produced from below: Nothing for us, without us]]
[[skills:Community Engament]]
A lot of tools and methods, to be honest\.  
Why?  
Because the journey includes mainly 2 main things or actually three main things\.  
One of them is the rehabilitation of, of the youth center to become like a community and climate hub\.  
The second part is to capacitate the, the, the people within the community hub in order to be able to sustain this work, but also be able to plan initiatives and projects, trainings, mentorship programs that would benefit the, the local community and also come with a new initiatives and projects\.  
So that's capacity building but also ideation\.  
And then the third part mainly is to do analysis and research for you and DP internally\.  
So throughout that journey we use different tools, but specifically sense making was one of the major methods that we used in order to collect insights and information about what's happening\.  
We also used design thinking approach in order to train the working committees on how to ideate for solutions\.  
We used the solution Canvas in order to document the solutions that we want to start implementing within the community hub in order to build the capacities of youth, enhance their engagement, support small entrepreneurs in the city\.  
We also in order to feed into our analysis and research, we use system thinking, issue mapping, stakeholders mapping in order to have a holistic view about the governorate and feed into the research that we do and then analysis that we do internally for UNTP, but also specific basically for our ACC project\.  
Of course the overall umbrella that led us to start this project is the portfolio approach\.  
So we use the portfolio approach in order to come up with this intervention\.

### [[9:20]] That's something, OK\. And what tactics and approaches did you use to engage, you know, different stakeholders, mainly specifically because this project you're talking with like various stakeholders, various levels, like you have government, NGO on the local community\.

[[principles:Human centering and adaptability: Less of me, more of them]]
[[tools:NESTA Collective Intelligence Design Playbook]]
[[tools:Design Thinking (for public innovation)]]
[[tools:Collaborative design of actions]]
I think brain flexibility was a big one\.  
We had to be flexible with our ideas, flexible to learn more because we read online something about this district\.  
But then when you talk to the people, they highlight different challenges, different opportunities\.  
So I think brain flexibility was like a really big one  
Second, it's building a shared vision\.  
We always try to position ourselves as part of this community\.  
We are not part of it, but position ourselves in the thinking of our partners that we have this shared vision and we're going in the same direction\.  
And we have the brain flexibility actually to adjust our own vision to match their vision\.  
So I think that was like a thing that we focused on doing\.  
Adding to that, of course, building a trust, it was very important from the beginning to build the trust to ensure them that you, NDP is here to do something for the community and give it back to the community\.  
The ownership is not ours\.  
It will never be ours\.  
It's yours\.  
So that's why you should trust us because we wanna do this for you specifically\.  
The fourth thing which I think was really important is finding a translator\.  
What do we mean by that?  
So we had a steering committee\.  
This is steering committee comprised of like the government, the NGOs\.  
They connected with us as UNDP, but also they connected with the local community\.  
So it's like they translated the challenges and opportunities and the needs of the local community to us\.  
Because this district is like 4 hours a drive from Baghdad\.  
It's not really easy to get there and we don't live there\.  
So you need these and say translators to translate all of these needs and tell us if something we are doing is not really in the benefit of the community\.  
So actually these were like the tactics that we use in order to, to, to, to go on this journey\.

### [[11:42]] I like that you capture about translation, you know, interpreting the insights\. And in terms of principles, can you elaborate on in terms of the key principles that guided your R&D work for this initiative?

[[principles:Human centering and adaptability: Less of me, more of them]]
[[tactics:Understanding the Community]]
[[principles:Inclusivity]]
[[principles:Recognize local expertise /Knowledge is produced from below: Nothing for us, without us]]
So I think the main principle is that it's it's in the back of our head as a club, is that the end goal is this local community\.  
Yeah, the end goal is these 120,000 people who live in this community\.  
This is our target\.  
And we should always, even if we want to, let's say, get innovative approaches or solutions from abroad, we should always keep in mind that it's for these people and whether it fits with their needs and reality or not\.  
So this was first  
Second, of course, inclusivity wanted to be very inclusive\.  
So we included various people from the local community\.  
We grouped them into six working committees\.  
Each working committee has five people\.  
So, so this would be our representatives from that community  
So inclusivity was like a big part of it, but also trust\.  
We builded a trust through, we went there and we engaged with them and we had like a fields mission\.  
So that made them feel that they can trust us\.

### [[13:16]] That's amazing\. I think it's all of those principles cannot be just one age where it has to go\.

They have to be 1 offer in order to actually be successful on this project\.

### 13:30 And in terms of the skills, yeah, throughout the journey, what are the skills that you have applied that you think it was very shaped your R&D journey to becoming a lot of soft skills, a lot of soft skills\.

[[skills:Sharing Knowledge, training, and unusual partnership]]
[[principles:Transparency]]
[[skills:Collective intelligence, video, visibility was key success, "press advisor"]]
[[skills:Community Engament]]
Soft skills were really major in this domain\.  
You have to be an effective communicator because and this effectiveness, I mean, you know, when, how to communicate with each different partner because government is different from like the NGO, it's different from the local community\.  
So I think effective communication and what was really an important thing adding to it\.  
I think the other softest call was let's say a bridging, I would say, because we always try to bridge between like the different partners and DP government and Geo local community who always had this skull of abridging in terms of technical, of course, analytical skills, qualitative research were really important because we wanted the aim is not only this project, the aim is to actually gather insights out of it\.  
So that was really important\.  
Yes\.  
Also the skill of imagination was good because we want to imagine how this will look like and and let's say 10 years, will it be sustainable?  
Is it not sustainable?  
We need to imagine how if we can actually like replicate the solution or not\.  
So I think that was a big part of it\.  
Also imagination how it's like the final project, how it will look like because we're the 1st to do this here\.  
So yeah, that was important\.  
Also storytelling was important because we always told them stories about other innovation hubs, other Co working spaces and what they achieved from their journey, how they helped their communities, their startups, their ecosystem\.  
And so that was also important in this domain\.

### [[15:49]] That's great\. And also were there other skills that allow you to kind of understand the challenges during the R&D journey?

[[principles:Human centering and adaptability: Less of me, more of them]]
[[tools:Persona Empathy Map within Design Thinking Methodology]]
[[tactics:Understanding the Community]]
[[principles:Empathy]]
Empathy, empathy, empathy was the big one, honestly, because you always needed to empathize with with the local community\.  
Yes, we are all Iraqis, but their journey is different from our journey\.  
So empathy with their needs, with their challenges, with their obstacles was really major\.

### [[16:19]] OK, thank you for sharing that\. Also, so wrapping, not really wrapping up but just want to get to the throughout the whole journey of when you started and all the process, maybe you just wanna get a sense and know more about the impact\. So what was the impact or outcomes of your R&D journey?

[[tools:From Insights to Impact:  Storytelling for Renewable Energy Solutions]]
[[tools:Co- created Environmental Citizen Science Solutions Mapping of national initiatives]]
[[tools:Co-Creation and Validation of Improvement Interventions]]
[[tools:In-depth interviews with repats (within Design Thinking Methodology)]]
So the project did not finish yet\.  
It's gonna end in end of this year\.  
But we've already seen amazing impact honestly\.  
So one of them is that like the rehabilitation of this facility, there's a facility now\.  
Now looks nicer, looks so brighter\.  
They have a new logo\.  
See that?  
Yes, it's amazing\.  
I'll show you all the pictures\.  
So they have a new logo, They have a new space that's nice and clean with the proper lighting\.  
So I think that was already something really good\.  
Adding to that, what we get got out of it is it's it's recapacitated this local community and also the government employees with new innovative methodologies\.  
And now they are already started implementing trainings and initiatives within within this community hub\.  
Moreover, I believe it's it's, how can I put it?  
It's Yeah, we already sparked the entrepreneurship ecosystem within that district, so there's already a lot of focus on this district\.  
So and also they started supporting startups in the community, so that was really good\.  
Moreover, they already started some climate change campaigns, volunteering campaigns\.  
So we achieved both the tangible no results of like the whole space being rehabilitated and all of it like the main parts that we wanted to rehabilitate because it's a big facility\.  
But also we achieved more of like the intangible things of like capacity building, spreading the importance of entrepreneurship and startups within the community, spreading the importance of building your schools in order to find the right jobs within the private sector\.  
And also now we have 2 main, let's say, local solutions\.  
One of them is to enhance tourism within the district and the other one is to support and waste management in the district\.  
So we've got tangible local solutions that will be drived by the community members\.  
The community have members themselves\.  
It's a huge impact\.  
I think it's like untangible all the very those capacities, the spark that you mentioned, that's already for me, I think it's already like the success rather important than the tangible, the actual facility\.  
And I just want to hear more about the learning\.

### [[19:37]] So what would you do differently if you had to start it again? Are there any learnings, anything you want to show?

[[tools:Increasing community engagement through community-growing incentives]]
[[tactics:Understanding the Community]]
[[principles:Human centering and adaptability: Less of me, more of them]]
[[tactics:Design the narrative flow and the stage to ensure the community and the desired outcome lead]]
I will quote you on that\.  
Moving slower, I think having it for this for one year was a bit tight\.  
So moving slower would have been a really good option because this has to do a lot with community, capacitating them and also engaging them\.  
And in order to do that, you need some time in order to to get them on board with you\.  
So I think this is the first thing that we would do\.  
Second, honestly, I would have visited them, the district more\.  
It's, you know, because if you have more time, you have more time in your work schedule, we can actually be present there more\.  
I think being present is really important for building a trust and for actually understanding the local community\.

### [[20:31]] That's great\. Yeah\. And in terms of the diffusions and catalyzation, I know you already touch a lot of approach strategies, which is more specifically and you know, to know more about what strategies or approaches did you employ to facilitate the diffusion, the adoptions that you already mentioned to your R&D outcome or output\.

[[principles:Transparency]]
[[principles:Recognize and promote agency: Enable agency, the greatest choice for the greatest number]]
[[principles:Recognize local expertise /Knowledge is produced from below: Nothing for us, without us]]
[[principles:Transparency and Honesty: Be open, transparent, honest]]
Basically, it's ensuring the government's buy in\.  
This is important, having the government part of this project\.  
So the Ministry of Youth is actually a leader in this project\.  
So already, even though we're gonna finish the project and handed them, already, they feel this ownership and they feel this buy in from the government\.  
3rd, it's really important to have the government\.  
Yes, we can work with innovation hubs, we can work with private sector, but when you work with the government, your change is institutionalized\.  
It's right there\.  
Now we have official letters from the Ministry of Youth saying that we will establish this community hub within the youth center\.  
So having that official letter and Iraq, it's a big deal\.  
You know, that's, that, that's the complete support and accreditation from the government\.  
So I think we already planned for this diffusion before even the start of the project to ensure that when we get to the end the, the, the local community, the local solution owners would already adopt this this local solution, right\.  
22:07 And lastly, just a little bit more in terms of, you know, engaging you mentioned about a government is very a key stakeholder and just want to know on how did you engage with the policy makers or like the private sector or communities that you mentioned really like in terms of how, how basically I would say like offline engagement, that was really important\.  
We didn't rely on online meetings and engagement\.  
So we visited them, they visited us\.  
We did I think 3 workshops so far, some of them since making some of them ideation, some of them communication difference\.  
But I think that that that like actual interaction was really important\.  
So and 2nd also they were with us like throughout the whole process\.  
So whenever you want to change something in the work plan or even to structure the work plan, they had a big role in this\.  
So we engaged them and the tiny steps that usually it's only done by your NTP side, but we got them on board with us\.  
So, so, so yeah, this is that's good\.  
I think like very important of like the actual interaction engagement of life\.  
I like that, that term of life\.

### [23:24]] OK, Thank you for sharing your wonderful R&D journey\. Do you have any final thoughts?

[[tools:Innovation Challenge]]
[[tools:Prototyping of solar mobile kiosk for Youths and Women running small street businesses?]]
[[tools:Scaling partnerships by demonstrating value incrementally]]
[[tools:From Insights to Impact:  Storytelling for Renewable Energy Solutions]]
Yeah, maybe I just want\.  
Yeah, maybe I just want to highlight a bit on catalyzation\.  
Yes, because our aim is to actually spread this concept of turning youth centers into innovation hubs or community hubs or climate hubs depending on the needs of the governor rates\.  
So in order to ensure that let's say youth and communities have a space because one of the main issues that innovation hubs, community hubs face in Iraq is sustainability\.  
They are not sustainable because they establish themselves as an NGO or a private sector\.  
And for that, when the funding is cut, you know, they don't really have that potential for sustainability\.  
So, so replicating and building on the model of a government facility turning into a community hub is really important within that domain to ensure that it's adopted not only by this district youth center, but also by other youth centers around the country\.  
Maybe not necessarily youth centers, maybe capacity building, you know, teams within universities, within schools, it depends\.  
But yeah, that was that is our aim\.  
We're not there yet\.  
We wanna finish this project 1st and then go there\.  
But this is the aim of it\.  
And of course, we wanna do it with the Ministry of Youth and Sports specifically\.

### [[25:04]] OK, wonderful\. Thank you very much for sharing this amazing journey\.

Thank you\.
