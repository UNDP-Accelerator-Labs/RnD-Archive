Solutions Mapper\-Peru\-Gabriel Lama

### [[0:01]] Could you tell us your name and your position, please?

I am Gabriel Lamma and I'm the head of solutions mapping in Peru\.

### [[0:07]] And can you share with us around the story?

I'm going to share a story about how to create a sense of belonging and how did it looks like\.  Well, we started working with a very vulnerable population, which are migrants in Peru, specifically Venezuelans, who are not only not welcomed there, but also punished by society because they are being showcased through the media as criminals and persons that are not adding value to society\.

### [[0:47]] So it is a story about how to change a narrative while discovering what does this community have to offer and to share with the welcoming group\. And what do some method did you use\.

[[tools:Design]]
[[skills:Creativity]]
[[tactics:Asset mapping]]
[[principles:Adaptability]]
Well, we basically use design methods\. We started with user profiling\. We talked with a very with a diverse range of migrants in Peru and we were discovering a very specific group that had our attention\. The migrant entrepreneurs, those ones who are there with their hands, their talent and their own background to put something valuable on the table for Peruvians and what skill were essential during your journey? I guess I use my engagement skills, skills that help me to create an atmosphere of a safe space for them to feel welcomed and also skills to create bonds among people in order to make them feel connected and a part of a community\.


### [[2:12]] And where did you have to pivot your course of training new tactics to get things moving\.

OK, well we tapped on the we started framing the problem as a as an opportunity\. We discovered that there were specific migrant entrepreneurs with Do it yourself spirit\. So we started designing and developing actionable knowledge and content for them to improve their skills while collaborating and exchanging among each other\.

### [[2:46]] OK\. And did you work with certain principles?

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[principles:Human centering and adaptability]]
[[principles:Adaptability]]
[[principles:Cultural adaptability]]
Yes\. I would say that the main principle we kept in mind while developing this R&D journey is that we all have something to learn and something to teach and that we need to\. We need to know that our end users have a lot of knowledge, valuable knowledge and skills and we just need to be open enough to create a horizontal relationship with them and from there to Co create and Co develop the journey and who was involved in your journey\. Well, the many we managed to involve in our journey many different collectives and organizations of migrants that were for sure developing their own businesses as well as working for companies or trying to find a way to survive and to produce and to get some money and resources to bring to their families\. So we Co created with them\. They were the protagonist of the way we did\. We programmed the learning journey\. We also work with banking and social innovation organizations\. We tried to tap into already existing communities of entrepreneurship, to make them be open to receive and to mentor Venezuelans and migrant entrepreneurs\. We also work with the government, with the Migration Office, for example, and with municipalities that are taking care of migrants in their own communities, trying to include them\. And we inspire them to create entrepreneurship fairs with where Peruvians and Venezuelans were able to show their products\. And we also like private sector, public sector, the Academy\. We work with universities and students who were part of our programs and who organized a journey discovery journeys as well\. And Yep, that's it\.


### [[5:13]] And could you please tell a little bit more how did you work with them?

[[tactics:Creating space for emerging themes]]
[[skills:Innovation management]]
[[tactics:Desiging the pipelines]]
[[tools:Innovation challenge]]
For sure\. Well we started creating formatting innovation workshops to make them Co create opportunities and also discover common paths\. For example, bringing the Venezuelan collectives with the universities and other institutions in the same in the same place to Co create what entrepreneurship journey, what a migrant entrepreneurship journey should look like\. And we also created with them a lot of content and we used a platform where they were able to get in and exchange through videos, sessions and learning materials their perspectives on what a migrant entrepreneurs entrepreneur is\.


### [[6:16]] How did it diffuse?

[[tactics:Systems thinking]]
[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[tactics:Desiging the pipelines]]
[[tactics:Creating space for emerging themes]]
Well we started diffusing, sharing our understand our understandings on what a migrant entrepreneur is, characterizing this data specific profile and sharing it valuable and insightful information about it\. So all their designers can tap into that specific user and design all their solutions\. Than just a learning, than just a learning journey like for example services, products and so on\. Then because we enable a digital space for entrepreneurs to exchange between them, they started their own channels like for example using their own WhatsApp groups without us there to exchange information about courses, new programs and other activities and opportunities for them to get integrated with Peruvian society\. And we also inspired other UN agencies and NGOs that improve their programs, focusing on this specific target, the migrant entrepreneurs\. That because they are the ones that are triggering a new narrative that brings a different message\. Migrants are not illegal because no one is illegal\. No, a person cannot be illegal\. That they are not coming here with empty hands\. They are coming here with their backgrounds, their talents, their point of views and of course that they are valuable and productive and they can show us a lot and teach us a lot as well\.


### [[8:03]] Did anything that happened during the journey change your mind? Can you tell me more about how that happened?

[[principles:Human centering and adaptability]]
[[principles:Self-awareness]]
[[principles:Empathy]]
[[principles:Trust]]
I discovered how much the sense of belonging is a basic needs we need a safe spaces to interact and to exchange with people and to discover that we are sharing the same problems\. Sense of belonging is important to others\. To sense of belonging is important to everyone\. To feel, to have a starting point, to co\-create solutions\. If you don't have sense of belonging, if you if you are feeling lost, then it is harder to find the right path for social innovation\. And there was a moment when things started to move\. There was like a moment, a critical moment in this journey that you can identify\. Yes, while implementing the learning, the learning journey\. While implementing this learning program we deployed through a platform in a digital way\. We didn't expect the users, I mean the migrant entrepreneurs to use or to attend the sessions in crazy times of the day like at 11:00 PM or 1:00 AM or 3:00 AM or 4:00 AM in the morning\. So we were not at the, we were not sharing the same time we were working with office with an office time frame\. So we had to adapt ourselves to be there for them, even out of our work hours\.


### [[9:57]] Can you share with us the story of 1 migrant?

Sure\. Well not only one, but maybe different profiles\.

### [[10:10]] Yeah, that it would be great\.

[[skills:Creativity]]
[[tools:Design]]
[[principles:Curiosity]]
[[tactics:Creating space for emerging themes]]
For example, Aussie do it\. Your the do it yourself entrepreneur\. She started selling, preparing and selling ice creams near to the beach and she was so successful and their ice her ice cream were so good\. Then she found a partner approving partner to open an ice cream shop\. But then with that they, with the resources that she generated, she started another business creating a sense for perfumes and then she started creating bakery\. So it shows us a story of resilience and adaptive force that you as a migrant have to open your own way in a new society is the same creative force that you need to be a business entrepreneur\. Yeah\. And then another one was the story of an old lady called Jolie\. We just started creating dolls for children, but this is something that she did for the past 40 years\. And through the program she understood what are the tools to make this profitable and started thinking about she started thinking about from a business perspective\. But this is not I would say like what I like the most on this story is not the fact that she got new skills or that through our program she improved her\. The her way of doing business is the fact that she mentioned and pointed out that never is too late and that she felt young again while addressing a new problem and a new learning journey\. So I think that to be an entrepreneur and to be a migrant and to be a social innovator is to be an apprentice all the time and to be flexible enough to discover opportunities around you and change your path and your decisions based on that\.


### [[12:20]] Would you like to tell us whatever you think that is worth sharing before ending?

Yes, I would like to share\. There is something very important that this experience provided me, which is that we are all valuable, that we are all, we all have something to to give and that no matter where we are, we are just a single community and we should be aware of that in order to address the other sustainable problems we have\.

### [[13:02]] Thank you very much\.

Thank you\.
