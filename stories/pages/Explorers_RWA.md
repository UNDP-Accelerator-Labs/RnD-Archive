# Reimagining Patient Care with Local Innovation

### [[0:01]] And your position?

My name is Maurice Rugwamigamo, I am the Head of Exploration and the coordinator of the Xelita Lab in Rwanda\.

### [[0:11]] Could you tell me about an RND activity you would like to share and how did it come about and when did it start?

[[tools:Innovation Challenge]]
[[tactics:Share your value upfront, not budget]]
[[tools:Systemic Design]]
[[tactics:Based on petition, get the message to the right person]]
There is one RND activity we are conducting currently over last year\.  
We conduct what we call hunger Innovation challenge is the hunger pitch fest where we source for different innovation and one of the solution, the innovation we got from different young people you are having how do they recycle scrap metals and all that to transform them into usable items such as robots and others\.  
So now we we realize we have a long queues waiting at the hospitals and also the time for the nurses and midwives is not used correctly\.  
And then we started thinking how can we leverage that robotics now to to shorten the time people spend with the nurses during screening\.  
These are screening of vital signs, things like temperatures, temperature, height, weight and the blood pressure\.  
Those can be done by the robot automatically and then feed that data into the system\.  
For now for the doctor start working on it\.  
So we engaged with this young person and we started Co creating on how we can prototype or come up with a proof of concept of what we wanted to achieve\.  
Hence we started that proof of concept which is available now\.  
And we have now a robot, a prototype which can as you enter to the hospital, you you wash your hands\.  
As you're washing your hand, it tests your height, the weight and can test your blood pressure and then even the temperature and scrape that into the system which the nurse now can affiliate to the to the patient\.

### [[2:22]] So and what was the development issue that you are trying to address in that?

We realize people spend a lot of time at the hospital and most and the time they the time spent, much of it is on during screening before you even meet actually the real doctor\.  
So the the the initial vital signs, it is a process which is tedious and long\.  
And then if we automate that using the robots, this really would help even the medical practitioners themselves, but also the patient that are coming to the hospital to use to for the good use of their timing\.  
So that is really what we are trying to to prove as a concept and Co create and together with this is in in the one of the Med tech or health technology, which is a heavily regulated sector and we want to go is this proof of concept\.  
We are now going to the next phase where we're going to iterate and experiment that at least within 10 hospitals to see the impact it's creating that we can measure and scrape the the change we have\.  
We wanted to introduce this being achieved\.

[[principles:Co-creation]]

### [[3:42]] So in this journey, who were the main stakeholders, what was their role and how did their input shape the research and development journey?

[[principles:Even when the Lab is not there (or UNDP) things should continue - we have tâ€¦]]
[[tools:AccLab Newsletter, as tool for spreading our knowledge]]
[[tools:Scenario analysis]]
[[tactics:Getting in there (positioning the lab in UNDP prodoc)]]
In this journey, we, we so far we, we were in the phase of proof of concept\.  
We spoke\.  
We spoke to few people who were at the hospitals\.  
We're also on different insights from the people grievances on the online social medias\.  
And then from there we started looking what kind of technology help\.  
So this is now the UNDP Accelerator lab and its three colleagues and now the innovator who had that idea, we come up and we started strategizing and coming up with the proof of concept\.  
So now we are entering the next phase is now which is more determinant, which will include more stakeholders\.  
This meaning actually experimenting it in the real setup that is an an actual hospital and also interfacing with the real patient\.  
So for now we had we were in the process of building a, a prototype or a proof of concept\.

### [[4:59]] And what tools and methods did you use and why? What factors influenced you using the tools?

Well, you know there is no one\-size\-fits\-all\.  
So as you go, you you could create, you use the tools that you think are appropriate at that time\.  
For instance, at some point we we could use AI, generative AI to come up with the concept and some insights\.  
The AI now has a capacity of, if you give it the right prompt, it actually generates useful insight, which you can now turn into ideas and even start operating on\.  
So we leveraged on that very much\.  
Then the there is also collective intelligence between the, the, the colleagues in, in the lab and the innovator and his and his team\.  
And also we, we did some kind of sense making randomly to different medical practitioners by pitching, we have this idea\.  
Do you think is an idea that is worth undertaking and going forward?  
So most of the the the people we asked, they liked it, especially the UN doctor in Rwanda who said, hey, I want to be the pioneer to test that kind of machine\.  
So he's going the UN clinic in Rwanda is going to be one of the, the whole the 10 hospitals we are going to experiment this machine from\.

[[principles:Collaboration]]
[[principles:Risk analysis and trust from stakeholders]]

### [[6:26]] And what tactics and approaches did you use to engage stakeholders to buy in and or to address the resistance to your RI and D work?

The tactic is what we are doing is simple\.  
We have started with creating a concept, a proof of concept\.  
Initially it was an idea\.  
Sometime they it is easily understood because they have seen and interface with people frustration with waiting time and all that\.  
But now with the next level of a proof of concept, with a natural prototype, this is going to be a tool\.  
Now we are, we hope we leverage and match by convincing the different stakeholders as we we do a full scale experimentation\.

### [[7:16]] Can you elaborate on the principles that guided your work in your R&D work? Why were they important? What are the ethical considerations or principles of inclusivity, equity or sustainability guided your research and development approach?

[[principles:Accessibility of knowledge]]
[[tools:Collaborative design of actions]]
[[principles:Recognize local expertise: Nothing for us, without us]]
[[principles:Ingenuity]]
Well, there are many principles which we haven't documented yet, one by one or one by one, but we use, we leverage the principles of creativity and ingenuity\.  
We we, we are not limited by our thinking or being rigid\.  
We are open into ideas as we explore and discover and then iterate and then this informed the feedback and the development phases of of our R&D we had initiative we are doing so the the other we did they are I wouldn't say the principles like they do no harm leaving no one behind\.  
So this is we hope this is going to really be a game changer and we looked at the risk it is posing\.  
So there could be risk where there is resistance from the maybe the medical practitioners who may say no where should we replace be replaced by a robot or things like that\.  
So the principles really those are some of the guiding ones\.  
I could off head tell you now, but if I do a thorough reporting, then we use allude to different more principles\.

[[skills:Adaptability]]

### [[9:04]] And what skills were needed to effectively identify and understand the challenges or the needs that you R&D? What other skills were essential during the journey and why?

[[principles:Deep listening to map beyond the tangible:]]
[[principles:Deep listening to map beyond the tangible: Listen deep and show you are listening]]
[[tools:Deep listening]]
[[principles:Human centering and adaptability: Less of me, more of them]]
The only skill which I would emphasize that was needed for this is the listening and listening completely\.  
When people are telling you have to listen, you don't\.  
You don't want to make your case\.  
You, you state the idea, but you let the feedback come to you and you listen you\.  
You overcome the challenges and then together collectively, you have something more important\.  
The other one is when you have the will and the willingness to do something and the passion\.  
So long as you're passionate and convinced you have the conviction that this is the right way to go, you keep pushing\.  
Those are and then the other skills, the technical skills, the know how all that comes in naturally because you have a passion of what you want to achieve\.

[[tactics:De-risking the intervention by promoting an incremental approach through R&amp;D]]

### [[10:14]] And reflecting on the journey, when you look at the impact and the outcomes, what was the impact or the outcome of the R&D journey and in terms of learnings, what would you do differently if you had to start again?

[[tools:Co-Creation and Validation of Improvement Interventions]]
[[principles:Even when the Lab is not there (or UNDP) things should continue - we have tâ€¦]]
[[tools:Systemic Design]]
[[skills:Making insights actionable]]
Well, we don't have the measurement for the impact yet\.  
As I said, we are going to a full scale experimentation in 10 hospitals and from there we'll be able to quantify the impact it is generating on the on the changes we wanted to implement in the society\.  
So really right now, hopefully after three months from now, we'll be having those kind of information and insight on the on the changes desired we have achieved\.  
And the other one is learnings\.

### [[11:05]] What would you do differently if you had to start again?

[[tools:Quasi Experimental Design Processes]]
[[tactics:De-risking the intervention by promoting an incremental approach through R&amp;D]]
[[tools:Randomized Controlled Trials]]
[[tools:Scenario analysis]]
I think I, I would have done it at once\.  
I do the proof of concept and and there's experimentation at the same time that would speed up my processes\.

[[principles:Collaboration]]
[[skills:Sharing Knowledge, training, and unusual partnership]]
[[skills:Collective intelligence, video, visibility was key success, "press advisor"]]

### [[11:26]] And then looking at diffusion and catalyzation, what strategies or approaches did you employ to facilitate the diffusion and adoption of your R&D outcomes? This one, the last one, you cut it the diffusion and catalyze, OK, so you have can you elaborate a bit more? And So what, what strategies or approaches did you employ to facilitate the diffusion and adoption of your R&D outcomes? How did you engage with policy makers, private sector communities or other key actors to catalyze broader change or impact based on your R&D work?

[[principles:Transparency]]
[[tools:Innovative approach - Design Thinking - Issue Mapping - Stakeholder Mapping]]
[[principles:Data sharing]]
[[tactics:Design the narrative flow and the stage to ensure the community and the desired outcome lead]]
We intend to use that evidence driven mechanism\.  
Once we have the data generated and insight from this full scale experimentation, we intend to start publishing different for different formats where we could influence the different stakeholder beat from the regulators, the government and even the practitioners themselves, even the the community at large\.  
So we'll be tailoring the different output or I want to say output or reports, which would be using depending on the intended beneficiaries\.  
So, and then, so things like we'll be blogs, reports, even some videos demonstrating the journey from where we started, the difference it's making, all that we'll be using as a combination of different methods and tools to convince and defuse our initiative\.

### [[13:35]] Thank you for your interview and for the insights and your time\.

Thank you so much\.
