# Empowering Artisans Through Digital Inclusion in Algeria

### [[0:04]] Hi Walid, welcome to this interview\. I would like to start by asking your name and your position and if you could share your country as well\.

I'm Walid, Walid Abulberry\.
So I'm an explorer at the accelerated lab in the Co office and the Co in Algeria\.

### [[0:22]] Now we would like to know an R&D activity that you have done in that country office, so you could share what it was and what problem you were trying to solve, right\.

So this initiative actually is a pilot initiative, a pilot project you could say with women artisans, so women who are involved in craftsmanship and handicraft work\.
And so the, this is in the context where the the handicraft sector is actually represents around a million and, and, and 100,000 jobs for maybe 3% of the GDP\.
And the, the main issue that this sector, this field of of the economy faces is a very low, especially during COVID, a drastic drop in the in, in sales\.
So products are not don't find, you know, markets to to be sold\.
And we thought that one of this cause could be the under the under digitalization of this sector\.
So this sector is totally under digitalized\.
It's totally outside the digital sphere\.
And it's, it might be one of the reasons why the, the, you know, the, the products of this area of the economy are not very well sold on the market\.
So, and this also comes in a context where the access to, to the Internet, to, to the the, to even mobile devices, there is a gap between men and women in Algeria\.
The overall, I would say coverage is quite good\.
It's almost 100%, but there still is a gap between men and women\.
So this probably aggravates the problem\.
Therefore, we came with this, with this initiative to try and see how we could bring female artisans into the digital sphere and how we can empower them and help them into marketing their products on the digital sphere and see whether they would be an impact\.
So it's a pilot project, we had the 1st\.
So it's actually basically a, a training\.
So it's like we accompany these artisans into how to use these, you know, digital tools, platforms, etcetera\.
And among a population that is very where the digital literacy is quite low\.
So yeah, we, we did this activity, the first activity last December, the first phase and the second phase will probably be done in, in the end of the this month of June\.
And by the way, I'm even in parallel of this first, I'm also coordinating actually the, the preparation of that phase\.

### [[3:59]] So I would like to know if you had partners for this journey with artists and women in terms of strengthening their digital skills, who were those partners and what was their key role in terms of going along with you in this R&D journey?

The I'll try, I'll first try to make you understand or explain the context, the bureaucratic context that we evolved in, in, in Algeria\.
So actually we work exclusively or we work through ministries\.
So we have to go through ministries to present the the the initiatives that we come up with\.
So we have to go through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs\.
So we sent them this concept note and they directed us towards the Ministry of Tourism and and Handicraft\.
So our main partner is the Ministry of Tourism and Handicraft that, that also manages the national registry of artisans\.
And so it's through that Channel that we, we have been able to reach the, the, the, the beneficiary population\.
And therefore that's what I mean, we have given them, we discussed the, the criteria, the selection criteria of the beneficiaries\.
There are a set of criteria, the, the level of, of presence in on the digital space\.
So it was like people who had under 100 followers, for instance, on their, on their digital platforms, you name it and so on\.
So we had this a set of criteria and they were the ones actually to, we also wanted a, a large coverage, a national coverage, but the idea was really to take a sample, a regional sample as a first phase\.
So we did it in 5 reliers in the in the West of the country\.
So and yeah, that's how we actually got to to deal with the female artisans\.  
Yeah\.

### [[6:33]] Thank you so much for the detail\. I would like to know which were the tools and methods that you use to work with these artisan women\.

[[tools:Systemic Design]]
[[tools:Human Centered Design (HCD) Workshop]]
[[tools:GIS system, qualitative interviews,system mapping, behavorial approach, ethnography, surveys, util因]
[[tactics:Finding allies]]
So I would say there are several of them\.
I think the most basic one is brainstorming, obviously\.
So you brainstorm with your partner, they know obviously the needs because they are very well aware of what is on the ground, what is the needs of the, the population, the beneficiaries of the, the women in these women who work in these, because we don't know these people\.
I mean, we don't necessarily know them\.
So the the national partner will already provide enough information for you to be able to, to identify who is who you are dealing with\.
And but we also had well, I would say classic qualitative research tools through forums, you know, through questionnaires that we distributed to evaluate to actually establish first a baseline where we are coming from in terms of levels of sales, in terms of levels of digitalization, where do they, where do they operate whether in urban or rural areas, which is also different because the coverage is not the same etcetera\.
So I would say all this qualitative tool and of course then when it comes to designing the, once you identify the need, you need to design the, the offer and the, the kind of training you will provide, the kind of input you'll provide\.
So that is very much a say, I don't know if you could call it yeah, people centered\.
I wouldn't be able to really how do you say identify the the the kind of tool, but probably something around\.
