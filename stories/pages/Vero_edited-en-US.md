# Solutions Mapper\-Argentina\-Maria Veronica Moreno

### [[0:01]] Please share it with us your name and your role\.

I'm Maria Veronica Moreno\. I'm head of solutions mapping at the Accelerator Lab in UNDP Argentina 

### [[0:10]] Gabriel Lama, head of solutions Mapping, UNDP Peru\. Do you have a story to share with us?

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[principles:Curiosity]]
[[tools:GIS systems]]
[[tools:Design]]
Yes, I have a story that shows that every can do research and all started doing the pandemic because we had low cost sensor to measure air quality\. So we that were developed by Open Seneca and so we deploy a pilot project with the Ministry of Environment and the government of, of the city of Buenos Aires to measure quality\. While there was the lockdown and because of that and because it grew into a project, we, we saw an opportunity\. So we have started thinking that we needed to, to map new citizen science initiatives because they were powerful and so many reasons\. And so we knocked the door of the former Ministry of Science and to invite them to join us to co\-create a solutions mapping strategy\. And as a matter of fact, we start mapping environmental citizen science initiatives\. And when we gather our first thirty solutions, we decided to organize like a launching event\. And we were going to tell like big news for us that that after that we are going not only to map with the state, but through the state in a collaborative way because people will have the possibility to upload their citizen science solutions and start the iteration with us\. So for us that was like a big moment and but after that reality took us by a surprise in a very good way, because there was a public authority that that that could recognize the value of citizen science to foster several SDTS, to gather data in a fast way, to involve communities in research, research projects that matter to them\. So he said that that they should design a national citizen science policy, which was like for us, like a moment that that changed the course of our journey because we didn't expect that\. And it was yes, we celebrated\.


### [[3:30]] So can you say that the public sector got inspired by the solutions you mapped?

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[principles:Curiosity]]
[[principles:Accessibility of knowledge]]
[[principles:Human centering and adaptability]]
Yes, that we mapped together\. Yes, the solutions that we mapped together definitely because when we launched the 1st edition, we were there with leaders of the citizen science projects\. They were telling in first hand their stories because they were we, we have data, we have a lot of, we have like mapping cars, descriptive mapping cars about every single project that we, we were there with a lot of different kind of data that that I think demonstrate show the the potential of citizen science to accelerate sustainable development\.


### [[4:21]] Can you name some of these citizen science initiatives in order to like explain us? Which categories did you found?

Yes, there are citizen science initiatives to map vector bone diseases from our country\. There are others that map mosquitoes to do real time monitoring of for example dengue\. There are others who work with communities to prevent some risk like floods\. There are there are different types of citizen science initiatives and that's for me, it's part of its beauty\. Like citizen science is a diverse movement and they and involve people that were doing like the extra mile\.

### [[5:20]] You know, what tools or methods did you use to do what you just described?

[[tactics:Getting in there]]
[[tools:Design]]
[[tactics:Systems thinking]]
[[tactics:Desiging the pipelines]]
We deploy\. First of all, for me, the most meaningful characteristic of our method is that it was a Co creative method\. We work with the state, with the former ministry of Science in a very Co creative way\. So we designed the whole strategy together\. At the beginning\. We start with key interviews and that show us the potential of the citizen science and that we could because of them, we could map several projects\. But after that, because it was growing, we need a collaborative strategy\. So we, we designed the platform, but well, it's a form that is in the, in the national website of our country where people can fill in the information regarding their projects\. And after that we iterate with them so we can show them, we can put them in, in our catalogues\.


### [[6:33]] Yeah\. What skills were essential during your journey?

[[principles:Curiosity]]
[[skills:Foresight]]
[[tools:Design]]
[[tools:Futures and Foresight]]
Several skills for me in every solution mapping involves like a sense of engagement, active listening and to be like stories\. Stories are pretty are really important to explain the beauty and the potential of every single development challenge\. So there was not like a single method because we did it in a qualitative way\. And then we start working with the firm and then we work on stories\. We did several things and I think that having different sorts of evidence was a good thing to grab the complexity of any development challenge or approach\.


### [[7:41]] And did you develop any skill during this journey?

[[principles:Human centering and adaptability]]
[[principles:Recognize and promote agency]]
[[skills:Volunteering and taking initiatives]]
[[principles:Self-awareness]]
Yes, I think so\. For me, in this kind of journey, what you have to do and you have to embrace is that you join the movement\. You join people that are already doing things like so first, like perhaps it's more like an attitude that is skill, but be humble because they were doing things before you came\. But after that, it's like trying to, to understand different opportunities\. For example, we work out loud in, in every single step of the way\. And because of that, we, we found new opportunities and we are working with the Ministry of Education of the City of Buenos Aires to Last year, we, we deployed a pilot project, a citizen science program in more than fifty schools because we believe that citizen science can foster several SDTS\. So we can work\. It can be a useful tool to democratize science, but also to improve certain skills in young people, like how to research\. And in the end it show it show us that everyone can do it\. Like it's that sounds like a principle\.


### [[9:27]] Yes, it sounds like a principle\.

So I mix principle and skills all in the same\.

### [[9:35]] I'm sorry, Vero and is there any example or story of maybe a group of teenagers doing something amazing with citizen science through your programs, your deep play programs?

[[skills:Analytical skills]]
[[principles:Curiosity]]
[[tools:Desk review analysis]]
[[tools:Literature review and desk research]]
I will tell story of a researcher that one day he went out to do field work\. He went with his PhD in his back and he was measuring water quality water\. And then a kid reached out to him and said, what are you doing? And he said, I'm doing this and that to measure\. And the kids said, well, that's so easy\. So he, he stopped at like a minute and say, it's not so easy\. Do it yourself\. The child said challenge accepted\. So he did it\. And then he brought the, the form that he was filling to the researcher\. And the researcher then like have an epiphany, like not only me can do this\. This kid from a low income neighborhood did complete the form almost exactly the way I did it\. So after that, he became like an activist in citizen science\. And he's the leader of several projects in Argentina\. So there are like, there are a lot of stories that had a moment when people realize that this can be the way to do things\. We can do things differently\. And as a matter of fact, it's a very rich thing to do Like, yeah\.


### [[11:35]] And would you like to share something about Anticipando La Crecida?

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[tools:GIS systems]]
[[skills:Creativity]]
[[tactics:Gaining leverage and traction for solutions]]
Yes, Anticipando La Crecida is a project that that work with communities and that are exposed to and to natural disasters like floods\. So they work with communities in their own territories to to map to map clothes and certain things related to that problem\. And they work in the river and so on\. And they work with low cost measuring instrument to measure, to measure water, rainfall water and so on\. So they apart from that or within that journey, they start organizing the community or the community, know the community and research and the local governments start organizing themselves\. Because of that, they could plan several like preventive actions that had an impact in their quality of life of the people there\.


### [[13:03]] How many practitioners did you found through this journey?

A lot of them and I will be in just because it is a moment that keep on growing\. So I cannot give you a figure, but we for example we map 100 initiative, so and in each initiative there are a lot of practitioners involved\. So there are thousands of there\.

### [[13:32]] Thank you\.
