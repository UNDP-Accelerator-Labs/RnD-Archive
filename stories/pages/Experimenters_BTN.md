# Experimenter-Bhutan-Kunzang Wangmo

### [[0:00]] I'm rolling and I'm going to ask you to say your name, your title and then say I consent to this recording\.

OK\. Consomo, head of experimentation, I consent to this interview\.

### [[0:14]] Great\. And take it away\. You can start at the R&D question\. Hi there\. Yeah, could you please introduce yourself briefly?

### [[0:29]] Yeah, OK\. I'm concerned with the Baton country office, with the accelerator lab as the experimenter\. So my question would be, what is that one development issue that you're passionate about and you're trying to address it with many different tools and methods?

So a lot of things are there in the country office, we are working on digital to energy to Highland Sustainable Fund\. But right now I am passionate and working really immersed in the Highland Sustainable funds\.

### [[1:03]] Could you elaborate on this? How did it started, Where did it start?

[[tactics:Working with ecosystem]]
[[tools:Data Power Positive Deviance (for sustainable livestock farming)]]
[[tactics:Asset mapping - nothing for us, without us]]
[[tactics:Gaining Leverage and Traction for solutions]]
So last year we had a field mission to the Highlands, which is about 4000 meters above sea level\. So we, we were looking at how can we localize STG's in that field machine basically to actually channel the small grants program into the really required areas\. So that's how it evolved\. And one of the areas that the yacht association, the Highland Highland Association, they say that their cattle were attacked by the wild animals and they have to move from 1 area to another area\. So the most vulnerable were the yard cows\. And I mean it, it generated from there\. So the the idea was from there\. And we partnered with one of the offices here to see how we can bring this Highland sustainable fund to channel dedicated fun to the highlighters\. That's how it's all started\.

### [[2:20]] And could you tell me like what skills were essential for your R&D work and for your experiments during your journey at country office?

[[skills:Futures and Foresight]]
[[tools:UNDP Foresight Playbook]]
[[skills:Making insights actionable]]
[[tools:Scaling partnerships by demonstrating value incrementally]]
So when I started back in 2020, we were required to do a lot of sense making to scenario building horizon scanning\. But then the key expect or the component would be of at labels would be learn quickly, learn fast and apply it fast in areas\. So yeah, skills would be the collaboration, behavioral insights to innovation, financing to I mean foresights\. So a lot of skills, yeah\.

### [[3:13]] And about the principles, can you elaborate on the principles that guided your R&D work and why they were important to you?

[[principles:Collaboration]]
[[tools:Collaborative design of actions]]
[[skills:Sharing Knowledge, training, and unusual partnership]]
[[skills:Making insights actionable]]
So in terms of the R&D and experiment work, I would say a lot of Co creation through collaboration with partners and it's not just within the ACT lab within the country offices\. But you really going beyond that then the other one would be action oriented, applying what we have learnt so collaboratively but applying what we have learnt together\.

### [[3:51]] So I heard about your crowdfunding campaign and could you tell me more about the then then why you started with this idea? What did you find it, you know, moving that you pursued to start crowdfunding campaign?

[[tools:Innovation Challenge merged with blended financing]]
[[tools:Scaling partnerships by demonstrating value incrementally]]
[[tools:Co-Creation and Validation of Improvement Interventions]]
[[tools:From Insights to Impact:Â  Storytelling for Renewable Energy Solutions]]
So it all started as a team and the crowdfunding Academy that was announced and we applied for it\. We got selected to go through the course of three months and we were trying to look for ideas and it was around biodiversity financing, innovative financing, but we wanted to start with a small quick wins\. So we we went with really small so be saving the baby yaks\. So that's how it all started\. But yeah, we start from there\. But we wanted to see how we can make it bigger and make it may be a highland sustainable fund, which is not looking at just channeling financing, but also looking into insurances, guarantees, you name it, other schemes are there\. So that's how it all started\. It's not just at lab, but we are working with the biodiversity finance people in the country office\. We're working with the comms people because comms strategy is really key for the crowdfunding\.

### [[5:11]] And then what would you say would be your outcome of your R&D journey, things you've done and you're planning to do?

[[tools:Increasing community engagement through community-growing incentives]]
[[tools:Scaling partnerships by demonstrating value incrementally]]
[[tools:Innovation Challenge merged with blended financing]]
[[tools:Citizen Science and gamification using digital platform to crowdsource solutions]]
I mean, if you just look at the crowdfunding, the number they're getting the money is the key\. So that would be a success criteria\. But as the R&D factory practice, I would want to see the crowdfunding maybe innovative financing, you know, people applying that in the whole of country offices and it's not just the country office, but then it's being adopted by the whole ecosystem\. So if we go into other financing sources and other institutions, we see crowdfunding as an area or maybe different financing scheme to reach out to the diaspora group outside institution outside to see how we can bring in additional new finances for development and for stitches\.

### [[6:13]] So the last question, what would you do differently if you had to start again your R&D journey?

[[tools:Collaborative design of actions]]
[[tools:Increasing community engagement through community-growing incentives]]
[[tools:Citizen Science and gamification using digital platform to crowdsource solutions]]
[[principles:Deep listening to map beyond the tangible:]]
Yeah\. So learning is the key\. Would I change that, maybe bring more people together? That way you'll have the whole, you know, group, which means you reach out to more\. Right now it's just five of us in the country office was pioneering the crowdfunding\. But if we could do that for the whole country, it will be amazing\. We need we need this stuff as well\.

### [[6:49]] what strategies or approaches did you employ to facilitate the diffusion and adoption of adoption of your R&D outcomes?

[[skills:Sharing Knowledge, training, and unusual partnership]]
[[skills:Multisectoral Partnership]]
[[skills:Multi Sectoral Partnership]]
[[principles:Recognize and promote agency: Enable agency, the greatest choice for the greatest number]]
I think relationship building and and really asking the right key questions to partners\. Do you want it to you don't want it? What is in there for the country office? What is in there for the Highland? How do we channel the resources? Those were one key question, but really building relationship with key people\. So if it is like Bureau of the external relationship, so knowing that right person and then communicating with them and the other one would be may be communication is the key\. So you just, yeah, reach out to people, you reach out to your audiences\. You have several meetings\. Again, meeting is also a building relationship, right? It's even though you're working in the same country offices, but you are so torn apart with your own priorities that you have to bring everyone on board time and again to have that\. Yeah\. So a periodic check on where you are going\.

## [[8:08]] So I would say that, you know, what I'd rather hear than about engagement with the private sector is can you talk a little bit about embedding within UNDP, sharing or having practices and types of work that were taken up by the country office?

[[tools:Collaborative design of actions]]
[[tools:Scaling partnerships by demonstrating value incrementally]]
[[tools:Co- created Environmental Citizen Science Solutions Mapping of national initiatives]]
[[tools:Co-Creation and Validation of Improvement Interventions]]
So do I switch, switch, switch examples\. Oh, do I just stick to no, no, absolutely\. I want to, I want to hear about that particular thing\. So I would bring foresight as an approach that the country office took\. It started with Aglab\. Again, it starts with a learning journey\.So we started as a learning journey with with the UNESCO team who's doing this features thinking kind of thing\. So it started there\. But it was again another learning journey from the regional office\. So they're they're doing this foresight playbook kind of thing\. So where we had to pick signals, trends, drivers from the country offices and give to them\. Now that intrigued us and we went to the Planning Commission then and say that, look, we have this tool, can we use that in the planning process? So we use that in the planning process for the whole country and the plan is going to be out\. So that's the 13 five year plan\. So we picked up lots, lots of signals\. Now that was one area that we did\. And there was another partner, academia that was really dying to do something new\. They had done design thinking\. They had done search inside yourself, but they wanted something new to look for future because COVID had just struck us with the pandemic\.  
It was diverse\. Yeah, it was a disaster for the country\. So they're looking for that and we act lab with governance team\. We built a course with the the Royal Institute of Management to have a foresight and strategic governance in the institute which trains the the new civil servant in the country\. So we trained 30 of them last year and this year we trained 50 of them\.So these people go into the government offices like they are the immigration officer, they are the HR officer, they are the finance officer, I mean planning officers\. Yeah\. So I think we have already captured that and now that has picked on and that idea, now our governance team wants to roll it out to the member of parliaments\. We've already covered one, I mean, set of the member of parliaments now\. I mean, every year it's expected that we have such\. Yeah, training and foresight\. So I mean, we are there, but yeah, we are in between right now\. Yeah\.

## [[11:18]] Thank you\. That's great\. I appreciate that\.
