# Experimenter-Namibia-Yrika Maritz

### [[0:00]] Give us your name and title and a brief sentence of consent to this recording\.

All right\. My name is Yrica Moritz\. I am the head of experimentation from Accelerated Lab Namibia\. And I briefly consent to this interview being recorded\. Did it done Condition You conditionally consent\. I conditionally consent\. Should I start again? I provide my full consent to this interview being recorded\.

### [[1:20]] Could you could you tell me about an R&D activity that you have done and when it start?

[[principles:Collaboration]]
The I think the longest R&D activity that the Accelerator Lab Namibia worked on was the work with the Public Service Innovation Champions at the Office of the Prime Minister\. We took the opportunity to partner with the Office of the Prime Minister at the launch of the National Innovation Policy, which took place in June 2020\. So what the Accelerator Lab had done was to find an entry point to working together with the Office of the Prime Minister through the Public Service Reform units\. They were very keen to find somebody who could train them in design thinking\. But I believe that as part of the experiment, we shouldn't just work with design thinking because that's only one approach and one tool\. What I had then done is I had taken all of the different tools and methods that we had been introduced at the boot camp\. And I, I had a conversation with the, with the colleagues at the Office of the Prime Minister and I explained to them that we need to look at public service innovation in a holistic manner and design thinking wouldn't be the solution to how public service could innovate\. So through the method and basically taking the, the approaches that we were introduced to at the boot camp, we had a collaborative conversation in terms of what would be required\. And in the process, we Co created a public service innovation toolkit that we launched\. And then we decided that we were going to embark on a learning design process for about 900 public servants, which we had collaboratively trained over the period of three years\.

### [[3:19]] Great\. What was the development issue that you were addressing?

[[tools:Scaling partnerships by demonstrating value incrementally]]
[[principles:Recognize local expertise : Nothing for us, without us]]
[[tools:Innovative approach - Design Thinking - Issue Mapping - Stakeholder Mapping]]
[[principles:Collaboration]]
We were addressing the issue around SDG 16 and 17, focusing on governance and and building strong institutions and also leveraging partnership for the goals\. But then at the same time, I felt it was an opportunity for us to start looking at ways of how we could bring the sustainable goals into the language of public servants\. Very often in in Namibia, when we talk about the Sustainable Development Goals, usually government doesn't really have ownership and they don't believe that advancing on the Sustainable Development Goals is really their problem\. It's a UN agenda, yeah\.

### [[4:09]] So who was involved in your journey? What was their role?

[[skills:Collective intelligence, video, visibility was key success, "press advisor"]]
[[principles:Collaboration]]
[[principles:Transparency]]
[[tools:Systemic Design]]
OK, so there were different stakeholders that were involved in our journey\. Firstly, it was the secretary to the Cabinet, so he's the principal secretary\. That is the interface between the permanent secretaries and also Cabinet Office, the politicians\. So it was very important that we involved him as a champion\. We also worked with the Department of Public Service Reform and Innovation and we worked with the learning and development offices that were represented across 28 office ministries and agencies\. And then it was the the accelerator lab\. We unfortunately didn't have a very, very fully constituted governance team\. So much of the work of the accelerator lab was basically on basically strengthening the governance project in the country office at UNDP\.

### [[5:14]] So how did you, how did you make the topics of and buy in your idea?

[[tools:Systemic Design]]
[[principles:Collaboration]]
[[tools:Collaborative design of actions]]
[[tools:Innovative approach - Design Thinking - Issue Mapping - Stakeholder Mapping]]
Well, firstly, the initial request from them was please can you bring us a consultant to train us in design thinking\. But because in in the lab we've got diverse skill sets, my background is in public policy and a public administration\. So I understood how public service works\. And our solutions mapper is a design thinking professional\. So she's been very well schooled in that\. So together the two of us put our thoughts together in terms of Co creating and Co designing a a workshop or designed a workshop together with the public servants based on their needs\. So it wasn't very difficult to bring them on board because we had already encouraged them to think beyond looking at design thinking as the solution\. So we included aspects of collective intelligence, Co creation, sense making, experimentation, doing exploration and working at grassroots level because what we wanted to do was really to enhance service delivery\. So that was the direction of our focus\.

### [[6:32]] So what I understand that the fixed sector innovation label that is the final result\. So from the request of one training on design thinking you introduce more tools and methods to the public servant\. So basically, what are tools and methods you use to guide them from the beginning to that final outcome?

[[tools:Innovative approach - Design Thinking - Issue Mapping - Stakeholder Mapping]]
[[tactics:Getting in there (positioning the lab in UNDP prodoc)]]
[[skills:System analysis and complex design]]
[[tactics:Based on petition, get the message to the right person]]
OK, so in the beginning, based on on the conversations that we had, we thought that we would introduce small sessions that would introduce the concept of sense making\. What is sense making? We started with where their understanding of sense making was\. We showed them different methods and tools of how to basically collect data from collective intelligence sessions\. We went out with the innovation offices to basically find out where are the pain points from the citizen so that we could include that as part of the design of the toolkit\. We also introduced to them facilitation styles, communication styles, basically asking questions and how would you ask questions that would derive value from the citizens in terms of improved service delivery\. We also use design thinking\. We develop user personas\. We did almost a iteration of business processor in engineering, but we used human service design principles and approaches\. So those were the main tools that we had utilized\. But I think at the end of all of that, it was really consolidating all of the different inputs from what people expected and what we could basically produce as a collective product\. So we've got a toolkit that we're rolling out with the public service\. We've handed it over and we're hoping that until in terms of scaling, they're going to be able to train more public servants and then find through that process and identify innovations across the public service\. So that was our our modality of collaborating with, with government\.

### [[8:56]] Were there any specific tactics that you use when you work with the government to, to make sure that they, they enjoy what you introduce and later they can, they can make it more fruitful for their work?

[[tools:Innovation Challenge]]
[[principles:Human centering and adaptability: Less of me, more of them]]
[[skills:Innovation management]]
[[tools:Innovation Challenge merged with blended financing]]
We did a couple of pulse surveys in the beginning to, to establish a baseline and we found that many really didn't know what innovation was\. I, I believe that the understanding of innovation from a public service perspective is doing something, something that they, they haven't necessarily done before\. It's not really looking at something that's grand and, you know, innovative and creative\. So for instance, when we ask people what have you done to innovate in, in, in your ministry? And people will say, well, I basically trained in gender mainstreaming, but that's not innovation, you know\. So it was really important to understand where people were so that we could build on that\. So part of the, I wouldn't say that there was a resistance\. There was more in openness because people had so many different ideas in terms of how they could improve the services, how they could restructure very bureaucratic print processes within government, but there was no place that they could use to capture that\. So part of our proposition to the office of of the Prime Minister was to start establishing a database in terms of, you know, which offices, ministries and agencies were already kind of forthcoming\. So we wanted to introduce a challenge\. But I believe that because the senior officers right at the top, we're not very keen on how would you basically launch a challenge\. In the private sector and in the startup ecosystem, it's easy to launch a challenge, but within the public service, you have to take it all the way to the Cabinet Office so that the Cabinet approves it\. So I think part of the strategy was really working through the Cabinet, the secretary to the Cabinet to do it so that we could have that overall blanket executive approval and then present it to all of the permanent secretaries to to basically sell the value of why innovation is necessary in the public service and link that to improve public service delivery\. So those are some of the the tactics that we have used, which are mostly soft skills and really negotiation skills, but also the ability to be able to speak to different stakeholders\.

### [[11:42]] So can you elaborate on the principles that you use in your ID work?

[[tools:Collaborative design of actions]]
[[tools:NESTA's Collective Intelligence Design Playbook]]
[[tools:UNDP Foresight Playbook]]
[[principles:Inclusivity and diversity]]
So the principles were we, we wanted to make sure that what we were doing would be broadly inclusive\. We looked at the composition of the different cohorts of of trainees that had gone through the different training courses\. We've documented how many women and how many men\. We tried to ensure that the the materials that we were producing were inclusive in that it was available in soft copy, but that it could be read across different devices so that there was a screen reader\. We've tried to make efforts to make the hard copy available in Braille, but that one is, is something that our disability unit wants to take up as a part of working together in terms of improving service delivery\. And I think I we've we've hoped to be inclusive in in, in terms of leaving no one behind\.

### [[12:57]] So when you work with the government to to impress with any, any moment or any yeah, any moment that the government try try to not to manipulate the way you're doing and to do to impose what they want\. How how did you deal with that ethical things?

[[tools:Scaling partnerships by demonstrating value incrementally]]
[[tools:Collaborative design of actions]]
[[tactics:Overcoming Resistance]]
[[tactics:Proof of concept]]
I think what was what was very interesting is that the, there was more resistance from the country office because they were not used to our ways of doing things\. This, this concept of Co creating and collaborating in the design of our experimentation and basically, you know, iterating the different phases was something that's completely foreign to how UNDP does things\. With UNDP, the resistance came from, you know what, why are you doing this? We would usually bring on board a consultant to do this\. You're spending far too much time with this and and from the country office\. The emphasis was more on we've got this money quickly, use the money so that we can report on delivery by June\. We don't want you to be spending too much legwork out in the field, but from the public service as an external stakeholder, they were very keen because they had absolutely no idea of how they were going to roll out this innovation policy\. And here we are presenting them with an opportunity to not only go through training sessions but learn from the process and work with us in developing outcomes that would operationalise their policy\. So, yeah, it's interesting how how that is actually played out when an aim to introduce and enhance the capacity on innovation capacity of the public servant you, you work a lot of them from the car design phase and to to implement and to understand the the whole process\. And finally the final outcome is the playbook\.

### [[15:05]] And So what are the skills you see needed when you work with public servants throughout this process?

[[skills:Collective intelligence, video, visibility was key success, "press advisor"]]
[[principles:Transparency]]
[[skills:Sharing Knowledge, training, and unusual partnership]]
[[tools:Innovation Challenge]]
I think at AI would say a technical level, it's really understanding public administration and management and understanding the principles and processes of how that innovation policy would be linked to performance\. It would be linked to service delivery\. It would be linked to all of the areas of planning, managing, leading and controlling in terms of public management principles\. But then equally the ability to communicate, the ability to be able to work across the different levels and structures, the the ability to be able to negotiate timelines\. Because in the public service, because it's so bureaucratic, you know, the things that we would think has of, of a time sensitive nature is not necessarily the way the public service would want to push through an initiative\. So for instance, in UNDP, if we say that the deadline is one week for the public service, if you would have to give them maybe one month\. So, so it's really managing the expectations and also managing the timelines in a way that allows you to be flexible and adaptable and and agile enough to accommodate additional requests as well\. So part of the additional request was to help them really do a kind of walkthrough in terms of making sure that what what certain ministries were doing were innovative enough\. Because I think there was there was almost a race for the different people who've been trained in, in, in, in this public service innovation to come up with innovations to be piloted and implemented\. Unfortunately the system doesn't allow for that because each ministry has got an accounting office or a permanent secretary\. And many of the times because your senior management hasn't been introduced to the toolkit\. Because we were working with the technical staff, that was a problem\. And I feel, I feel that that's, that's, that's the, the biggest challenge in terms of how we would implement and infuse public service innovation in the in, in, in public sector organisations\. So maybe with hindsight, if I could do something differently, I would recommend that we do we do we train not only the technical officials, but also introduce it to the very top structures so that the leadership would be able to embrace, you know, this concept of innovation and that they would actually be monitored in terms of their performance agreements\. So that it's seen as it's part of what they're supposed to be doing\. It's part of their general objectives and that they should be measured on it\.

### [[18:15]] Yes, it's a good idea\. However, in fact, when you try to train the top leaders, it's also very challenging\. Do you have any ideas pop up of our mind now to how to evolve that top leaders in throughout the training process?

[[principles:Transparency]]
[[tactics:Understanding the Community]]
[[principles:Recognize local expertise : Nothing for us, without us]]
[[tools:Increasing community engagement through community-growing incentives]]
I, I believe working with working through the resident representative because the resident representative has a lot of good connections with our senior officials and also understanding where the government wants to go\. So if government has launched this policy, then surely it has to be linked to a broader purpose and a broader agenda\. But I, I believe that, you know, having great conversations and using the, the RR to broker these conversations with our national partners in, in selling the value of public service innovation would be one of the key things that I would want to do differently in the future\. And, and, and perhaps our resident representative could then be talking about, you know, what kind of innovation initiatives are working not only in the country office, but across UNDP\. So it's really just, you know, talking about the good things that are happening within UNDP and using those as case studies to, to introduce the value of public service innovation to the public service\.

### [[19:41]] What was the outcome of your ID journey with the public servant?

[[tools:Quasi Experimental Design Processes]]
[[principles:Even when the Lab is not there (or UNDP) things should continue - we have tâ€¦]]
[[tactics:Designing the pipelines]]
[[tools:Scaling partnerships by demonstrating value incrementally]]
The outcome was actually very interesting because in terms of quantitative numbers, I believe that we did quite a lot because we trained in over 2 1/2 years, 900 public servants and it was literally just two, two of us in the lab\. We did this obviously with training officers and the innovation champions, but we took the lead and what we had done in such a ways, we'd phased it so that in the 1st 2 sessions of training\. Accelerator Lab took the lead and then in the second two sessions, we combined it\. We basically divided the facilitation in half\. And then in the last iteration, the Accelerator Lab basically stood back and the public servants did 75% of the training\. And we then just provided, you know, advice and a kind of mentoring that was the impact\. It's, it's, it's difficult to say, you know, what the actual impact is because currently, even though public servants are innovating in their own space, it's very difficult to scale this innovation because of the bureaucracy\. But what, what is, what is interesting is that a lot of these public servants are taking the tools that we're using and they're using it within their own teams\. So the toolkit itself has been, has seemed to be quite successful, but in terms of birthing new innovations, I, I think there's still a lot more work to to focus on\. I believe in creating an innovation ecosystem, which would then include involving the private sector, NGOs, communities to Co create and design solutions that would be more citizen centric\. But the public service is very much, you know, kind of confined to we will just work with public servants\. So perhaps as part of the next phase, it would be really to how do you enhance collaboration and how do you bring on board other stakeholders so that there's there's there's a differentiation in terms of the ideas and really operationalizing collective intelligence\.

### [[22:05]] You can congratulation because at least they used your tools in the in the within the team is the small action, small changes that's made later\. They will use tools for designing the new program with private sector or with the community\. It's what we what we can they can predict\. So what is the coming strategy or approaches that you you will you will use to facilitate the diffusion and adoption of your Ind outcome?

[[tools:Collaborative design of actions]]
[[tools:Citizen Science and gamification using digital platform to crowdsource solutions]]
[[principles:Recognize and promote agency: Enable agency, the greatest choice for the greatest number]]
I've been thinking about a lot of things\. I've been thinking of bringing in the public sector, the private sector, but also the communities to have, you know, these kind of citizen assemblies\. And, and I'd like to, to basically structure them in terms of themes, in terms of governance, in terms of, you know, improved service delivery, in terms of looking at the youth unemployment\. And through that process, introduce at different levels, you know, these conversations so that we can capture all of this this this information or data in a way that we could help design policy guidance notes for the government that can be presented a Cabinet Office so that those deliberations can then be filtered through and then can also influence development programming at the National Planning Commission\. So I'm really putting innovation at the centre of all of these public service reform efforts\. But then at the same time, I do believe that it's important that there is a champion that's going to, you know, spearhead that that process\. As part of that initiative, I'd like to also introduce innovation challenges called, I don't know, I was thinking around public service innovation hackathon\. We, we would invite different, different stakeholders, but also government officials to come up and showcase their solutions that can be prototyped and even piloted so that we're incentivizing people at the technical level\. But then we're also showing your high level officials and even the citizens to to basically, you know, support the piloting and later scaling of these innovations\.

### [[24:43]] So the Champions here are very important\. Yeah, absolutely increase the Champions and they\. Yeah, yeah, a lot to to generate larger impact that you expect\. So thank you a lot for the interviews, for your time

And thank you and thank you so much for those interesting questions\.
