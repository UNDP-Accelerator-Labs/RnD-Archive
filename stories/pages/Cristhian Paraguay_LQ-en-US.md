# Experimenter\-Paraguay\-Cristhian Para

### [[0:00]] OK\. What you could do is first tell me your full name, your full title and say I consent to this interview\.

OK, so I'm Christian Para, I'm head of experimentation at UNDP Paraguay of the Accelerator lab in Paraguay and I do consent to this interview\.

### [[0:17]] Great\. So it's over to you to start there with R&D activity\.

Sure, take it away\.

### [[0:26]] So Christian, could you tell me about and the activity that you would like to share, how did it come about? Where did it start? Tell me the story about it\.

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]

[[tactics:Systems thinking]]
OK, so I think I want to speak a little bit about the mapping with it during the pandemic of initiatives for responding to the pandemic\. So we were basically we were working with something called the National strategy of Innovation, facilitating workshops with, for them to design A national strategy of innovation and challenges as part of that strategy\. But then the pandemic came and the whole kind of like design process came to a halt and they started to go, OK, what do we do now? Right? And that's when they, because they have seen us kind of like facilitating these kind of activities, they and, and they, they knew about our, kind of like our, and the kind of like capabilities they turn to us to think what, what could we do to kind of like keep the strategy moving\. And one of the challenges that came from the, from the, from the design worships was actually to be resilient against epidemics because we had, before the pandemic, we had epidemics on dengue\. So that was something that was already there\. So then we use that and say, OK, you, you already identified this as a challenge and we are actually leaving this challenge now\. So why don't we start by trying to understand what people are doing to, to respond to it\. And, and that's when we started to, we did a lot of interviews with different actors with, we engage with civil society to try to come up with an action\. It eventually became the idea of building a map of initiative\. And then we were basically in, in the tension between building from scratch ourselves or, or developing ourselves or trying to use something that already existed\. In the end, we can kind of went to the second option\. We started to use a platform called Ushahidi and that was actually already personalized for these by an organization called Frena la Curva or stop the curve of the pandemic\. And we just basically did kind of like a, another version of it and use that platform, but in, in collaboration with a group of civil society, different organizations, we started to populate the map, right? And there were some civil societies organization working on hygiene points or they were working on trying to map communities of kitchens\. And then institutions also came along\. Some institutions started to map their offerings in the map\. So it started to grow\. And by after some time, the map became like a source of intelligence about what was happening in the pandemic, right\. And yeah, so mapping that was I think that there are there are any activity that, that I would like to talk about\.


### [[3:27]] So as I already talked about, you were doing this under the pandemic, that was the main development challenge\. Would you want to elaborate more on the other underlying challenges that you will face as you were?

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[principles:Always increase social capital]]
[[principles:Recognize and promote agency]]
[[principles:Human centering and adaptability]]
Yeah\. So, yeah, the main development challenge was by all means the pandemic, right? And trying to contribute to make sense of it\. In this particular case, maybe some other underlining challenges were this lack of synergies, collaborations and articulation between public institutions and civil society to tackle the pandemic\. So in a way they aren't the, the participatory mapping that we kind of like started and the articulation that we kind of like role that we played be bringing together different organizations and, and different institutions from the public sector and actors\. That also was kind of like a, a way to tackle that challenge of having people to collaborate and to make synergies right\. So I would say that's a, that was an underlining challenge\. And I think 1/3 underlining challenge was that because it was integrated into the national strategy innovation, which is a which was a team within the presidential delivery unit\. I think the other challenge was how does this work that we are doing informs that strategy, right? Because whatever happens in the future, that's the need for that strategy to kind of organize the innovation system and aim their activity store more mission oriented, kind of like activities, right, was also still something needed\. And this whole mapping became also a source of intelligence for that exercise to kind of like refine what that strategy needed to look like and how it was, you know, how it needed to be articulated\.


### [[5:25]] So, so you were already in the next set of questions I wanted to ask about was the key stakeholders\. And it kind of relates to your second challenge\. So you did mention that you were working with the other depression's delivery\. You need the innovation team, as you said, but who else was with you?

Yeah, in trying to grapple that challenge of getting people to collaborate to work together\.

### [[5:51]] OK, an otherwise fragmented situation\.

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[principles:Recognize and promote agency]]
[[principles:Always increase social capital]]
[[tools:GIS systems]]
Yeah\. So I would say maybe we can divide this into, right, there were some key stakeholders for the mapping and articulation of initiatives, right? And there the, the key take stakeholders were Habitat for Humanity as a civil or society kind of organization, another local organization called or a roof for, for my country, right? Because they were doing like work on, on the social or informal territories where people were not still living in, in kind of like illegal territories, but they were working in that place because those places were of high vulnerability\. And then some networks of community, the base community organizations like in, in one of the vulnerable territories where we were mapping the soup kitchens, there was a network of coordination of those soup kitchens that can like they started to, to put the, the, the, the data in, to put their, their soup kitchens in, in the map, right\. So that's going to kind of again, in the articulation side, on the more like collaboration, institutionalization side, the presidential delivery unit is, is, is the main one at the time that presidential delivery unit was a very relevant actor in the government\. So they were like the coordinating unit for all the different innovation and also coordination aspect between different institutions\. And that changed a little bit in later on, right? Other institutions took on that role, but in that moment they were that\. I think another key actor was the network of organizations that were working internationally in Frena la Curva\.


### [[7:49]] So Frena la Curva or Stop the Curve was an international kind of movement mostly based in, in this Hispanic American, kind of like a hyper continent, right?

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[principles:Recognize and promote agency]]
[[principles:Always increase social capital]]
[[tactics:Creating space for emerging themes]]
So there were people from Peru, from Ecuador, from Central America, from Spain and from Argentina\. And they all had their own kind of like mapping initiatives, right? And, and we were engaging with them constantly\. Maybe another actor, I think is, is some private sector enterprises\. Like, for example, there was one called Tiendas PE who, which started as a platform for, to put like to sell online products during the pandemic because people then didn't need to, because there was this need of buying without leaving the house, right? And, and they already had like a map also, or a database of, of people who were selling stuff or offering something\. And they kindly kind of said, we also want our data to be in the, in the map in a way, right? So we started to collaborate with them\. They were part of some of the activities\.


### [[8:57]] And then I guess the other key stakeholder could be the, the, the country office itself, but particularly within the country office\.

Let me think a little bit about who, who kind of like participated, right\. Maybe we had some initiatives with the environment area in the office that kind of leverage on this map to, to for example, to do some innovation challenges around urban spaces, right? Or to kind of like put on some, some data about recycling or waste management practices, right\.

### [[9:39]] So yeah, that I'll get back to that point on the, the kind of the other uses of the of the mapping to learn the platform\. But since we were talking about kind of the broad slate of stakeholders that they were working, you may or may not need to name one\. But perhaps in dealing with the more difficult stakeholders, what kind of tactics or approaches did you did you take to engage them, get their buy in and contribute to ensure the?

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[principles:Human centering and adaptability]]
[[tactics:Getting in there]]
[[principles:Recognize and promote agency]]
Yeah, that's a good question actually, because one of the problems we had was that as part of these ecosystem of actors 1 actor that I forgot to mention is that there is like a community of more informatic or computer science oriented tech technical people, right? And in the different conversations when we were designing the initiative, they were also part of the conversation and attention arose because there were some of them who wanted to kind of like build from scratch, develop from scratch their own kind of map, right? And they saw like the possibility of choosing an existing platform as kind of like going against sovereignty or something like that in the country\. So they had this nationalistic kind of kind of view\. And, and at some point I was about to kind of break the process because they were very relevant to the presidential delivery unit, other initiatives, right? So then what we did is we went on and we started to do like in a very human centered approach, we started to interview many people from that community, right?


### [[11:17]] And, and with the question, OK, how do you think we can approach these building a platform for, for mapping this kind of initiative Where, where, what do you know? What do you know existing ones? What would be the challenge of creating a new one? What is the challenge of choosing an existing 1 and personalizing anyone?

[[tactics:Getting in there]]
[[principles:Trust]]
[[principles:Recognize and promote agency]]
[[principles:Immersion and engagemen]]
So in the end, that approach of putting a halt for a moment and then taking a week or two to really interview, talk people and, and make sense again of what they think allowed us to get to the point where they themselves said, yeah, actually, maybe this is a better option\. And then it, it provided us with legitimacy to work on the choice that we have made regarding how to approach this right in terms of the platforms we're going to use or the tools and methods we're going to apply\. And he also, you know, by doing this set of interviews and trying to, you know, very, very human centered approach of designing it kind of like diffuse the tension\. So maybe they in the end it became like only one person who just wanted to kind of let himself develop something, right\. He's the only person who kind of like kind of like remain upset in a way\. But the remaining actors were all already kind of like born in in consensus, right\. And yeah\.


### [[12:35]] So that that was yeah, that's an interesting story\. And I think one last question\. Oh, that's what the last two questions, last two questions, we're at 13 minutes\.

Sure\.

### [[12:48]] OK, sorry\. So I guess I won't delve into the tools already, but I just wanted to say it's interesting that you use the tool as a tactic\.

Yeah\.

### [[12:57]] So I think I guess if my last two questions, the 1st is I guess what were the core principles that you were using or inviting when you were undertaking this?

[[principles:Recognize and promote agency]]
[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[principles:Transparency and Honesty]]
[[principles:Prioritize transparency in methods and openness in sharing data and results]]
Yeah\. So I think, I think one of the core principle was we really wanted to be to this for be bottom up, right\. So we wanted these, we knew that the presidential delivery units, the Civil Society Act, they were all doing things right\. But we wanted to make sure that the things they were doing were somehow informed by what was happening in actual vulnerable territories and with communities that were struggling\. And, and that they kind of like saw that it wasn't only what they were doing, but also what the communities themselves were doing\. Like, for example, these communities of kitchens around the communities of kitchens\. There was a whole organization happening, right? And it was really a self\-organized kind of movement\. And it was very important for them to kind of look at it and see, OK, what are the challenges that they are facing and how are we going to respond to it? Right\. So that was one of the pieces principles really to make sure that the whole process was bottom up and that we could sort of face up actual needs and problems that maybe we're not the been taking up in talk on higher the latter\. And in the other principle, I would say it was to be in whatever way he we're going to sign, to be human centered to, to use command center design in a way to really build upon the experiences, concrete experience of the people who were involved\. And then abstract them into actual proposals of, of things to do or, or the, or the platform, how to use it\. Or for example, we really try to make sure that the different typologies of information that we want were mapping came out of the group of people who were governing in a way the, the platform\. And, and at the same time, I think another principle was not to reinvent the wheel\. It was really, let's not try to do like if someone is already doing something that is better, let's invite them over and let's kind of share everything\. For example, there was another map that was focused on neat\. So people were like mapping things like mapping requests for help, right\. And so what we did is we didn't really try to map that also because it was already that, but instead just, you know, try to make them talk, right? And we try to kind of like a show the information from the other in this map or try to use that map to when they were meeting to take that into account\. And, and yeah, and both actually later on were combined in another in the activity later on the was to study how the interpersonal networks in the social capital reduce vulnerabilities\. And that was kind of like a way of those two initiatives coming together\. And another example of narrow inventing they will like using what was there already to build upon\.


### [[16:03]] Yeah, I guess just to just to wrap it up and of course the pandemic is pretty much done\.

Yeah\.

### [[16:11]] And as a way of telling me what was the kind of sorry as a way of addressing your third challenge or and how does it connect to the innovation? So what's the, how is the platform now currently use for I guess for a different purpose or by other actors?

[[principles:Even when the Lab is not there things should continue]]
[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[principles:Ingenuity]]
[[tactics:Systems thinking]]
Yeah, so I think there are two ways in which these diffuse and catalyze right in a in a first stage for some time after the when the pandemic was kind of like coming down already, the platform was kind of used for other innovation processes and one of some of them of our own, some other from other institutions\. But eventually something that really diffused wasn't so much the platform, but two things\. On one hand, the intelligence we were able to kind of like make or the sense making that allow that, that, that whole that allow us to do right\. We were able to see that you know food security was one of the pressing issues\. We were up to see that maybe we had to focus also on small SM ES that we're trying to and that influenced the whole portfolio of the lab later on\. It took us to do a specific R&D activities that we're all kind of inspired by what we learned in that process\. And the second way that, that it diffuse and it catalyze is the activities that we went on to do as part of these mapping\. And then, you know, group of people who, who are working together, they kind of like a, they were the proof of concept of, of, of how important it was for the public sector to gain or to, to, to build their capacities for R&D and innovation\. So eventually when we were doing these things, then the public sector bought into the idea of creating a public innovation program that was nationwide and, and oriented to public officials, right\. And that program is already three years on and what that problem does is training public official in the same kind of methods and ideas and processes that we were using through all that initiative, right\. So it's the methods that kind of like diffuse and catalyze this new program that is now taking those methods into other units and creating a mechanism for them to generate constantly solution pilots and really developing the capacity of the public sector in this case\.


### [[18:43]] Thanks so much, Christian\.

Thank you\.
