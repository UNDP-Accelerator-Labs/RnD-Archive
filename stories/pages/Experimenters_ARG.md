# Experimenter-Argentina- Lorena Moskovich

### [[0:00]] So we are rolling\. Tell me your full name, full title\. And I consent to this recording\.

I'm Lorena Moskovich\. I'm the head of experimentation of the Argentina Accelerator Lab and I consent to this recording\.

### [[0:15]] Great\. So it's over to you for this first question\.

### [[0:21]] OK\. Hey, Lorena\. So today I'm going to ask you about R&D activity\.

Hi, Ali\.

### [[0:27]] So could you tell me about an R&D activity that you would like to share today?

[[skills:Sharing Knowledge, training, and unusual partnership]]
[[skills:Futures and Foresight]]
[[skills:Multisectoral Partnership]]
[[principles:Collaboration]]
Yes, of course\. I think that con boss which is which means with you network is one of them most interesting activities we made at the lab because it started with a solution we mapped in the lab\. We work in a very collaboratively way\. So we devised our projects and our learning loops together\. And so we had this learning loop on financial and digital inclusion\. They are by 2019 and in a low income neighborhood of the Buenos Aires province\. We met Sabrina\. Sabrina, she owned in store where she sell supplies for schools like pencils or you know a notebooks and maps\. And she also supported her neighbours with the things they need to do with her computer, when they had to request, for instance, and a special permit to travel, to get discount in public transportation, when they had to apply for a government subsidy or when they have to pay their credit card\. Sabrina would support and help their neighbours\. They net, they they her neighbours may have computer or cell phones to do it by themselves, but they don't dare\. And Sabrina could was someone they they trust in and she would explain them how to do it and she could charge a little fee for and for her services and which were affordable for which was affordable for the neighbours\. So we sought this solution had a lot of potential and we partner the secretary of commerce and production of the municipality of conception in Intra Rios in Argentina\. And we built together a network of nervy stores who would offer these services\. And we made an experiment trying to understand if we subsidy the demand of the services by distributing coupons, for instance, or if we encourage the supply by giving some of the store owners printers, whether the network would work better or not\. To make the Long story short, the network was a success that later called the attention of the sub secretary of public innovation of the federal government\. And thanks to a track fund, we scale it twice for the second time in a different municipality where the the city where we scale it was very, very different in the the result of the initiative were that not only people go online with more of their task procedures, but they also save money and save time by doing these errands online and avoiding going to the city centre\. And also this was particularly important for people with care responsibilities, particularly women, because sometimes they don't, they don't have to\. They didn't they didn't have anyone to leave their children for in order to do to the city to do all these things online in person\. But the point is that this solution called attention of the digital Singapore Digital Center\. It was included in the Handbook of Smart Cities as an example of grassroots smart city practice\. It was very much aligned with the two catalyzers of the innovation and digitalization\. We were the catalyze catalyzers in the you're going to edit this, isn't it? We're going to edit it\. OK, which is the don't worry so but but start a sentence again\. OK, no, but which is the name of the thing that the you know, the like the the the the the main document of the of the Bureau like the No, no, the other one there\. You mean the it's the document for the whole UN agencies or no, no for NDP from the the strategic plan? So again, so it was very important because digitalization and innovation were the the main catalyzers for the goals of the strategic plans\. So this example, this initiative was taken as example as a very frugal and and very effective way to foster digital inclusion in low income neighbourhoods\.

### [[6:29]] Perfect\. Thank you so much, Lorena\. That's a very detailed overview of you\. I'll be went through most of the questions, but I, I would like to kind of ask a little bit more specific ones around\. So you did describe the development issue that you are using\. So can you tell me a little bit more about the situation? What was the situation like in the development issue specifically?

[[principles:Recognize and promote agency: Enable agency, the greatest choice for the greatest number]]
[[principles:Never deplete social capital, always increase social capital]]
[[tools:Increasing community engagement through community-growing incentives]]
[[principles:Transparency and Honesty: Be open, transparent, honest]]
OK, so the situation is I think it is twofold for the government\. Sometimes they it couldn't reach the people at local level will will some procedures or or or or some yes, for instance, they have services or subsidized and that really the people wouldn't apply for because they either didn't know about them or they couldn't manage to go to the city or to the government offices to to apply for them\. And so they were particularly worried about fostering the use of all the digital platforms the federal government already had, but they weren't used at the local level\. So this, this is 1 of this part of the problem\. And of course, the previous problem was the pandemic, because the pandemic rocketed this kind of situations that we found in different mappings, we found this solution taking different forms\. For instance, sometimes they weren't the shopkeepers, but social leaders who support neighbours or neighbours supporting other neighbours\. But so this kind of intermediation in which a peer who knows a little more supports you to to give us a step further was a very effective and and and frugal form to achieve higher levels of digital inclusions\. And also you realize that near shop nearby stores are a means of introducing technologies at the grassroots level, like printers, cell phones, before the mobile phones, they, they, they phone themselves and now computers and, and, and actually going online, not only having the computer, but they are to encouraging the neighbours to dare to, to do it online\. But for the size of the, of the, of the people of, or the population there, there was a need of support\. Also, there was a need to, particularly during the pandemic to apply for the subsidies the government was handing out\. And, and, and, and also many, many procedures ended up to be only online\. So, so it, it also happened that for some companies or, or some errands, they didn't have the chance to do it in person\. So it was very important to foster digital inclusion\.

### [[10:17]] Thank you so much\. And, and just from that point and about Sabrina, I want to know more about the stakeholders in this genre, right\. So who are they? What was the role and can and and how did you ensure that diversity? Like how did you ensure the diversity of stakeholders in your project and in your army? How did I ensure diversity endure?

[[skills:System analysis and complex design]]
[[principles:Inclusivity]]
[[principles:Ingenuity]]
[[tactics:Design the narrative flow and the stage to ensure the community and the desired outcome lead]]
OK, OK, perfect\. OK, perfect\. Well, our first stakeholder was the the owner of the product or the owner of the solution and we wanted to recognize her\. So when we first scale this solution in the in the municipality of Conception de Uruguay in Intro Rios, we hire her to train community focal points who were in charge of recruiting the nervy stores and following up how things were going and gathering the data on each a neighbor who approached the store and on the procedure this neighbor, each neighbor made there, because we also evaluate and we tested how this solution unfold and we had two or three knowledge products with the result\. So the first one was Sabrina, of course, The second was this the secretary of production of the municipality of conception\. She was our first ally that allow us to go to the territories because by then we have no money at all\. So she offer us human resources to to build the network and and then it called attention of of the federal level and and so it was a serendipity\. How could I say a positive situation in which we ally them sub secretary of in public innovation at the federal level\. And at the same time there was a call for the fun truck, the the structure fund and our RR supported us to apply and we we got it\. And then our third allied or our 4th allied was the municipality of Fryman Martinsky in a very different province\. So we have quite diverse set of actors, OK and a say holders\.

### [[12:55]] So I would like to ask about from that point of view, like what, what type of tool and message did you use and that you just described and and why? Why did you use this method like and what factors include your choice of tools and methods?

[[skills:Creativity, organisation, open mind]]
[[tactics:Working with ecosystem]]
[[tactics:Gaining Leverage and Traction for solutions]]
[[tactics:Asset mapping - nothing for us, without us]]
OK, so first of all, we developed this network\. So we go at the grassroots level and one by one we we approach each store and for approaching this store we had to develop a set of tools and set of yes instrument to train them\. So we developed manuals, handbooks with examples of errands they could conduct with the neighbours, how to treat the neighbours, how to look for the things they didn't know\. And also we\. So we did a very comprehensive field work strategy by which first we recruited like a field coordinator\. The field coordinator was in charge of managing the community focal points who who were recruiting, training and following the stores\. And so we also had a very, how could I say minded brand strategy to because storytelling was crucial to engage our the stakeholders involved in the action, our partners, the neighbours\. So we, this is the reason why we gave a name, we had merchandising for the storekeepers to encourage them to, to, to put stickers in the in their shops and to give some gifts to the neighbors who would use the, the network, the the neighbors who use the network\. So, first of all, this very comprehensive field work strategy with a brand, with materials, with handbooks and 2nd, we made this an experiment and with A and with a survey and we and we conducted an experiment with different treatments both for neighbors and for a store owners\.

### [[15:43]] Amazing, amazing 1\. So can you tell me what was the outcome of oddly, Jenny? OK\.

[[principles:Ingenuity]]
[[principles:Even when the Lab is not there (or UNDP) things should continue - we have t…]]
[[tools:Quasi Experimental Design Processes]]
[[principles:Transparency]]
So the outcome was that the the the testing of this solution\. So it it was like a very virtual cycle of our method because we have exploration and financial and digital inclusion\. We had the solution mapping, we mapped the solution and we managed to test and scale the solution\. So the cycle was completed and, and since we mapped the solution in 20 in 2019, where we were also kind of learning how to do our jobs and testing the lab methods, it was also it gave us legitimization for their both the country office and, and, and external stakeholders and partners\. Also, we had these two experiments or the one experiment and one project in which we could test whether the neighbors save money and, and distance\. And we in the second edition and the average saving distance for each neighbor was 7 kilometers and, and they saved\. I don't know like five or six hours for each errand\. And so we tested also how did it work in in order the spillover effect that went beyond digitalization\. It was a means of decentralization as well and the localization of the SDCS\. And 3rd, we, we had the chance to know more about the reasons why neighbors would use the, the, the network and they would use because they didn't dare to do the things by themselves, but also because they didn't know how to do it\. So it showed us the need of this solution\.

### [[18:00]] And what would you do differently if you had to start again? So, OK, we're going to have one last question\. And I would choose what strategies or approaches did you employ to facilitate the diffusion adoption of your R&D outcomes\. What strategies yes or approaches did you employ the diffusion and adoption of your R&D outcomes?

[[tactics:Share your value upfront, not budget]]
[[tactics:Design the narrative flow and the stage to ensure the community and the desired outcome lead]]
[[tactics:Gaining Leverage and Traction for solutions]]
[[tools:Innovation Challenge]]
OK, well, the the first strategy was partner someone who would be open to test this new idea or this new solution and which was the 1st edition of the network\. But with this quick win, we had a product to to show to to different partners\. So it gave leverage to keep on promoting the idea and to scaling it in different places\. So a quick win is, is is crucial with a partner who would be willing to offer their time and resources\. So I wouldn't work with a part for the first time with a partner who who don't buy the idea, but who don't buy the idea as a whole\. That's it\.

### [[19:29]] Oh, thank you so much\. And for that, let me throw one more question at you\. I'm sorry, but can you talk just real quick about embedding within UNDP? Have you had any success? And if so, what was that What did that look like?

[[skills:Collective intelligence, video, visibility was key success, "press advisor"]]
[[tools:Innovation Challenge]]
[[skills:Sharing Knowledge, training, and unusual partnership]]
[[tools:Collaborative design of actions]]
OK, So while then the 1st edition gave us leverage to to show the solution to a different authority and we went from the local level to the federal level, the conversation with them\. Secretary of the Public innovation gave leverage to go to the country office and and to tell our our resident representative, you know, this person is interesting in in in this solution\. How could we put all the things together to to do it to do it together, because it would be also it was an unusual partner for the for the office\. So the, the partnership to scale the combos network would also give the office the chance to, I don't know, arrange or to organize different kinds of collaborations as well\. So this this, this was the path\. So first municipality, there's a federal government, then country office\.

### [[20:57]] Great\. Thank you so much\.
