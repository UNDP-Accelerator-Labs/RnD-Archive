# Empowering Youth Employment in Laos: Co-Creating a National Job Matching Platform Through R&D and Stakeholder Collaboration

### [[0:01]] Hey, how are you doing?

Good\.

How are you?

### [[0:04]] Can I know your name and your country as well?

Yeah\.  
I'm Laguna Alun Tong\.  
I'm from Laos\.

### [[0:11]] Nice\. When did you join the lab?

I joined the lab just last year\.  
Exactly\.  
Like about one year\.  
That's nice\.  
Yes\.  
That's nice\.

### [[0:19]] Such an exciting journey, huh?

Yeah\.  
Awesomeness\.

### [[0:22]] So actually today we want to talk about your projects or amazing work and what you like your, let's say contribution to R&D specifically in your country\. So we'll have some questions\. So basically we want to know if you can tell us about an R&D activity that you would like to share, how did it come about and where did it start? So maybe something simple just to set the ground for us about your R&D activity\.

[[skills:Sharing Knowledge, training, and unusual partnership]]
[[skills:Community Engament]]
[[tools:Innovation Challenge merged with blended financing]]
[[skills:Collective intelligence, video, visibility was key success, "press advisor"]]
So, okay, so like where you can just start with the R&D activity and then I'll give you the questions again\.  
Yeah, okay\.  
So this initiative, it's about, it was about supporting a government and building a website or platform for job matching\.  
So it's a job matching platform that is under labor market information system, it's a national platform\.

### [[1:23]] And how did you come about this opportunity?

[[skills:Collective intelligence, video, visibility was key success, "press advisor"]]
[[tools:Innovative approach - Design Thinking - Issue Mapping - Stakeholder Mapping]]
[[principles:Inclusivity]]
[[tools:Co-Creation and Validation of Improvement Interventions]]
So before we came up with this initiative, we will it allows we publish a a sixth national human development report\.  
And in with this, this report was very specific about youth as a drivers for sustainable development\.  
And there were a lot of, you know, analysis their recommendations to analyze components on youth and related specific about youth\.  
You know, youth employment and skills development came up with very crucial issues and quite a few recommendations from research\.  
And we we know that it's the big umbrella about youth employment\.  
And as explorer, we kind of like sense and explore what's what are the opportunities, the gap that we could work on\.  
And there was one specific thing that the countries needed is having one like one stop service platform to for informations about employment for skill training for young people\.  
So we were like, this is the time and we interested to unpack more and want to, to, to, to find the opportunity to like how how can we do with this opportunity that is coming?

### [[2:49]] Awesome\. So I think here you also dived in into the second question, but I will ask it again so we can have a specific answer\. So what was the development issue that you are addressing?

So specifically the development issues is the on youth employment\.

### [[3:06]] Yes, OK\. And who you did it with like who are the stakeholders involved in this initiative? And what was their role in this initiative?

So mainly the stakeholder for this initiative is government because it's government owned platform and at the ministry level because it's related to the policy as well\.  
And but not only government, it's one of stakeholder, we need to also we also involved it private sectors who also are employers and of course youth\.  
Yeah\.  
And job seeker who are going to use the platform\.

### [[3:47]] OK, Can I know who specifically in the government you worked with?

OK, so the government is the the Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare who has a role and and mandate about labor\.

### [[4:02]] Yes, nice\. And how did their input actually shape your R&D journey?

[[tactics:Understanding the Community]]
[[principles:Collaboration]]
[[principles:Recognize local expertise /Knowledge is produced from below: Nothing for us, without us]]
[[tools:Participatory Future Thinking]]
So, so the the inputs from the government, they so going back to like the story of like, OK, we were finding the opportunity, right?  
And then we found this, this could be an area that we could work with\.  
So we went to talk with the government and kind of like the government see that we have shared a common priorities to work together\.  
So their inputs were kind of like they opened a way like a opened for for us to collaborate and really like really wanted to be on board in working together and supporting all of those informations to to work with us\.

### [[5:02]] Great\. So if I reframe what you said, it's basically you're saying that the motivation of the government to scale up this platform was actually the gateway, yes, for your R&D journey\.

[[tools:Participatory Future Thinking]]
[[skills:Making insights actionable]]
[[tactics:Understanding the Community]]
[[tools:Collaborative design of actions]]
So that's what as part of this\.  
And another thing was also how to say the we, yeah, yeah, yeah\.  
Basically like we shared our priorities and wanted to work to work together\.  
And it's also the government priority, yes\.

### [[5:36]] So alignment of priorities, alignment of priorities, yes\. So now we're going to dive deeper into these R&D elements\. And the first thing is we want to know what tools and methods or exciting tools and methods that you used in this initiative\. So overall you can start from the Sense sync or from the testing or from scaling, but what are the tools that you used?

[[tools:Innovation Ecosystem Map]]
[[tools:Innovative approach - Design Thinking - Issue Mapping - Stakeholder Mapping]]
[[tools:Systems mapping]]
[[tools:Citizen Science and gamification using digital platform to crowdsource solutions]]
[[tools:UNDP Foresight Playbook]]
[[principles:Co-creation]]
[[tools:The Future, Backwards]]
[[tools:Futures wheel]]
I think the tools that we used were kind of like the mapping, you know, we use this basic tools of Excel to map, you know, the initiative around this ecosystem stakeholder mapping and traditional analysis around like, you know, doing this research literature review before we came up with this initiative and what type of tools\.
Yeah, that's, that was the first part that we, we did\.  
And I'm, I'm not quite, quite sure what time which could be the tools, right, because it's related to website development\.

### [[6:56]] OK, so first of all, you did mapping using Excel sheets\. Second, did you collect data about employability in the private sector?

[[skills:Volunteering and taking initiatives]]
[[tools:Data analysis, Machine learning, evidence based methods, survey (EPCV DHS)]]
[[skills:Community Engament]]
[[skills:Collective Intelligence]]
Yeah, yes\. So we also did specific tool is queries\.  
OK, so it's the survey tool to collect the data around youth around yeah, youth employment initiative, skills training initiative for for Eli\.

### [[7:27]] So OK, good\. And did you make any sense making sessions with the youth or the private sector or not really?

[[tools:Collaborative design of actions]]
[[tools:Systemic Design]]
[[principles:Humain Centered Design]]
[[principles:Recognize local expertise /Knowledge is produced from below: Nothing for us, without us]]
[[tactics:De-risking the intervention by promoting an incremental approach through R&amp;D]]
[[tactics:Overcoming Resistance]]
[[tactics:"Buy in" means agreeing to a tangible commitment]]
[[tactics:Play don't preach]]
We did not specifically did a sense making with youth or private sector because they the national human development report was done\.  
It was like very holistic approach of research already\.  
So the research source is the report itself\.  
Yeah, the report was there, but we did the Co creation with the government and Co design as well with the private sector because this platform is kind of like complex that involve multiple sectors\.  
And we wanna make sure that the platform design and for for the align with the the what the users really need to see in that\.

### [[8:22]] And if I want to dive deeper into the tactics and approaches that you used in order to engage your stakeholders and to make sure that they have the buy in and they are committed to this initiatives\. Or if they if you couldn't really get them to have the buy in, what are the tactics within the to address the resistance that you face from them?

[[principles:Trust/Authenticity: Build trust as a must]]
[[tools:Scaling partnerships by demonstrating value incrementally]]
[[principles:Recognize local expertise /Knowledge is produced from below: Nothing for us, without us]]
[[tactics:Play don't preach]]
I think first of all it's about convening, convincing stakeholders to be on board and kind of like we sense and try to get the buy in by doing slowly building trust with partners, yes, but at the same time we're not really trying to sell hard\.  
Our concept, our ideas, the innovative ideas of trying to integrate on advanced technology and auto generated model within the platform, that's the behind the scene\.  
It was kind of like for those people who do not have technical background, they might not really and totally understand, but what we did was trying to slowly get the sense and understand what do they want\. so we offer, we framed our offer and our service that's to align with their, their, their, what they want awesomeness\.

### [[9:52]] And can you talk more about the principles that guided you in your R&D work? So why they were important, these principles like what principles you use and why they were important?

[[principles:Inclusivity]]
[[principles:Inclusivity and diversity]]
[[principles:Inclusivity]]
[[principles:Trust/Authenticity: Build trust as a must]]
I think one thing through the website development process, we really try to focus on inclusivity\. We're trying to include all relevant stakeholders in there, but it's contents why we also trying to to step back and see whatever content that's published is inclusive, not gender bias, for example, like we, we, we trying to like before traditionally when they published a job vacancy, they were just like, we want just only men specifically or women specifically for this type of job\.  
But we trying to make a change of that\.  
So I think inclusivity is a big thing, a big thing\.

### [[11:01]] Are there any other like within principles, were there any other ethical considerations of you already mentioned it inclusivity or equity or sustainable sustainably guided your R&D approach Transparency also, I'm I'm there, we're trying to be transparent of whatever, whatever information is there and building related to the, the model that published the dashboard of the job positions in there\.

[[principles:Transparency]]
[[principles:Transparency and Honesty: Be open, transparent, honest]]
[[skills:Collective intelligence, video, visibility was key success, "press advisor"]]
[[principles:Trust]]
It has to be transparent\.  
They related to the sensitive information as well around the salary range, so on\.

### [[11:48]] What skills you need it to effectively identify and understand the challenges or the needs for your R and DI?

[[principles:Trust/Authenticity: Build trust as a must]]
[[skills:Sharing Knowledge, training, and unusual partnership]]
[[skills:Creativity, organisation, open mind]]
[[principles:Human centering and adaptability: Less of me, more of them]]
Think first to really be opened\.  
Really be opened\.  
Open minded\.  
Open minded, Yes, trying to gather as much as information as you can\.  
Not really like being biased\.  
That's also going back to part of the principles of not being biased and also the communication skill, convincing skill with our partners because we involve many stakeholders\.  
And in this case specifically, I think technical skill is very important because it's involved with data science, it's involved with website development\.  
If you only have, you know, being a good project manager or think of only the the innovative, being very creative, maybe it's will give you a difficulty when you communicate with the technical person, kind of like you have to speak in the same language\.  
So that that's really part of it and what it's really help us to, you know, keep be motivated and trying to push our work to achieve our goal\.  
What we want to achieve was being patient, being patience and yes, focused on our direction, calm to kind of like and be flexible, flexible\.

### [[13:33]] We're coming to the last part of this interview\.So if we wanna step back and reflect on your journey, what was the impact and the outcome of your research and department journey? I don't want to give you all the questions\. So maybe we start one by one\. So what was like the overall impact, if you want to look at it?

[[skills:Making insights actionable]]
[[tools:Innovation Challenge merged with blended financing]]
[[skills:Collective intelligence, video, visibility was key success, "press advisor"]]
[[tools:UNDP Foresight Playbook]]
I think I'm the impact was that we could influence other stakeholders, especially policy makers, the government and private sector to kind of like come back and focus on, on to see the importance of this tool\.  
And to see the importance of that they need to continue develop policy around employment and labor market because we kind of like raised and brought this issue up and demonstrated a tangible product that they could see and interact with\.  
That was part of the the, the impact that I think is valuable and the outcome for now, I think the outcome will turn in a longer term because then our website was just only just recently finished in March, so a couple months ago\.  
But the outcome was is the foreseen outcome is will be a long term period\.  
And we expect to, to, to see that this platform will be a tool that young people, job seekers and private sector can will use this tool to, you know, to find each other\.

### [[15:21]] And what are the learnings like? What would you actually, if you go back do differently if you had like to start all over again?

[[principles:Even when the Lab is not there (or UNDP) things should continue - we have t…]]
[[tools:Scaling partnerships by demonstrating value incrementally]]
[[tools:The Future, Backwards]]
[[tools:Participatory Future Thinking]]
[[tactics:De-risking the intervention by promoting an incremental approach through R&amp;D]]
[[skills:Sharing Knowledge, training, and unusual partnership]]
[[principles:Collaboration]]
[[principles:Disruptiveness]]
I think it's to start all all over again is I think maybe kind of like being more slower in terms of trying to accelerate the process because it's kind of like very complex\.  
It's involved multiple stakeholders and we wanted to make sure that everyone is fully comprehended on what we trying to achieve together and what our offer are\.  
But I for now, I don't regret for the on on the result for for now, because we the outcome, the output that came out\.  
This is already valuable\.  
A lot of people, government development partners, stakeholder, private sector already talked about about labor market information system in Laos and also been in the discussions of what we can contribute and how, how we're going to do with it\.

### [[16:39]] So you've already done an amazing work\. So if we get to the last part of diffusion and capitalization, what strategies or approaches did you employ in order to facilitate the diffusion and adoption of your R&D outcomes?

[[tools:Participatory Future Thinking]]
[[tools:Future Thinking (for human mobility)]]
[[tools:Scaling partnerships by demonstrating value incrementally]]
[[tools:The Future, Backwards]]
So the strategy for the diffusion and to the ownership to may ensure adoption of your R&D outcome\.  
I think first was the how to say, not sure if you have the word for this specific strategy, but it's more like you trying to sense and find the right partner to work with right timing as well\.  
It's very important, as I said, that if last year 2023, if the government did not put in their priorities, probably our project will not going to be this having this much progress\.  
I think finding the right moment, the right time and really put, really put to have, you know, put ourselves in, in their shoes where we have empathy of really trying to understand what, what the other stakeholders really need because our work is not really for us for ad lab, for UNDP, but it's actually should serve others\.  
So that's, I think that's the main, main point\.  
And another thing is that, you know, development issue is very challenges\.  
It's very difficult\.  
There's no one way to solve it\.  
And for this specific initiative, we cannot solve it\.  
And I think other partners, government development partners feeling the same\.  
That's it's very complex\.  
So I think what we what we've done and I think was the great was that we really focused and trying to motivate others as well re emphasize our objective, our goals\.  
If it's kind of like off track, then we bring them together and really, also really trying to find a strategic way to push as well\.  
So I think that's, that's the main, main part\.  
I I'm not sure if it's gonna what's the name of strategy, but this is that was the way that a thing is to achieve it\.  
Yeah, it was very, it worked very well\.

### [[19:25]] And one last question\. How did you and I think you answered it throughout, but it's good to highlight it\. So how did you engage with the policy maker, private sector, communities or other key actors in order to catalyze broader change or impact based on this work? So how did you catalyze it with policy makers, private sector or communities?

[[tactics:Understanding the Community]]
[[principles:Deep listening to map beyond the tangible:]]
[[principles:Human centering and adaptability: Less of me, more of them]]
[[principles:Deep listening to map beyond the tangible: Listen deep and show you are listening]]
I think in terms of how I think as we just directly reach out to them and try having the really like listen and learn from their side of what\.  
They've been through what are the challenges that they have right now and what are the goals that they want to achieve, basically understanding the ecosystem\.  
I think that's very important\.

### [[20:19]] Thank you for this amazing initiative and for sharing it with us\.

Thank you so much\.
