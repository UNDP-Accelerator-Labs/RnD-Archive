# Experimenter-Panama-Betty Chemier

## [[0:00]] OK, please tell me your name and your title and say I consent to this recording\.

Hello, my name is Betty Chemier\. I am head of experimentation for the AT club in Panama and I consent to this recording\.

## [[0:13]] Perfect\. So over to you for this first RT question\.

## [[0:21]] Betty, could you tell me about an R&D activity you would like to share with us?

[[tools:Portfolio approach CPD]]
[[skills:Multi Sectoral Partnership]]
[[skills:Sharing Knowledge, training, and unusual partnership]]
[[principles:Collaboration]]
I'd like to share about the work we are doing around the portfolio on social cohesion in Panama\. Yeah\. So this portfolio started with the support of the SIU office from Istanbul, which is the development of our portfolio process\. It was, it has been a very interesting R&D activity because it has involved many different actors and many different employees from our CEO\. So from the RR all the way to program officers to program coordinators, over 30 people from our office participated in Co creating this portfolio, which led us to understand that one of the root causes of the structural problems in Panama such as inequalities lied in social cohesion, the lack of social cohesion\. So we understood that social cohesion is around trust, trust between people, trust between people and institution\. And we started to think about like, how might we really bridge that gap between the people and the institution to create more trust among society and therefore solidify a little bit the democracy and yeah, and the social cohesion in Panama\. So this is what we are currently immersed in\.

## [[1:52]] So you already responded to the second question, who was involved in the this social collision portfolio experiment for instance and what will was their role in the experiment?

[[tools:Portfolio approach CPD]]
[[tactics:Portfolio approach]]
[[tools:Scaling partnerships by demonstrating value incrementally]]
[[tools:Systemic Design]]
The portfolio started mostly internal with our country office and it was very much led by our\. But from that portfolio on social cohesion we have derived several experiments\.

## [[2:26]] So maybe I can give you one or two example of those\.

[[principles:Inclusivity and diversity]]
[[tools:Quasi Experimental Design Processes]]
[[tools:Collaborative design of actions]]
[[principles:Inclusivity]]
One of the experiments that we are doing is an experiments using generative AI technologies to understand the drivers of social cohesion through participatory design processes in communities between young people and elderly adults through the design of public spaces\. So these are some experiments that we are doing to really understand what elements need to be inputted into the infrastructure, the public space, the public design and the process of participation for people to have more social cohesion\.

## [[3:11]] OK, Now what was the outcome of your R&D journey?

[[tools:Innovation Challenge]]
[[principles:Collaboration]]
[[principles:Ingenuity]]
[[principles:Transparency]]
Of this R&D journey, I would like to say, yeah, this is it is a journey we're currently immersed in\. But I can say that so far as in terms of outcome, we are seeing that we have a lot of demand for innovation and for inputting our methodologies into the work of our CEO\. Meaning that we have officers and RR and, and different areas of our office who are asking for us to provide the with the methodology and, and research and innovation into their project\. And I will give you a specific example of that\. A couple months ago, our RR asked us to how could we get involved into the human development report, which is this staple UNDP document to make it more attractive and to also find a way to hear the voices of young people and how could these voices be integrated and also shown into the report\. So for that, because our human development report is based on is about inequalities and the drivers of these inequalities are climate change and digitalization, we design these workshops with two universities in Panama in which we invited young people to use generative AI to visualize climate risks in their in their neighborhoods\. So this design workshop, this experiment allowed the young people to see how climate change could actually impact their environment\. And with these images then led to a conversation with the students that was very revealing for our HDR because they talked about really their relationship with the environment, with the build environment, how they face resilience, what are their ideas in front in facing climate shocks, How do they visualize their life in the future and how climate change can impact them\. And all this information is being embedded in our HDR in a human development report\. So this is an example of the impact of working on this social cohesion portfolio and how it is transpiring into demand for innovation into different part of our of our office\.

## [[5:48]] OK, thank you\. How would you measure the impact of this portfolio experiments I do proud of your impact you have done\.

[[tools:Collaborative design of actions]]
[[tools:Co- created Environmental Citizen Science Solutions Mapping of national initiatives]]
[[tools:Scaling partnerships by demonstrating value incrementally]]
[[skills:Sharing Knowledge, training, and unusual partnership]]
I again, it is it is a process that we are currently immersed in\. So I won't say that we're at an end of a journey where we can measure impact yet, but how to measure it\. I could definitely say that we are gathering new partners to work with this\. We have managed to put our work into a product that is with the Panama Canal Authority\. It is the biggest project in the UNDP Panama pipeline\. It's a $32 million project in which we have embedded our innovation and collective intelligence methodologies\. So we're about to start working with the Panama Canal\. So another, so a way to measure it would be the amount of new partners we're working with under the same thing of social cohesion\. Then the amount of methods, workshop or solutions we are providing to our COI think this is a way that we could really measure the impact of this work\. It's not so much a work in in the amounts of numbers of people impacted by an experiment yet, but really it's more about how we are embedding the systems, thinking the way the way the the lab really works, on participation, on Co creation, on designing intervention in a systemic way and how this is being adopted by our office and by how people at UNDP work\.

## [[7:35]] Yeah, thank you\. So if you want to change something in the process as learning, what will you do differently if you have to start again?

[[tools:Collaborative design of actions]]
[[principles:Transparency]]
[[principles:Never deplete social capital, always increase social capital]]
[[principles:Transparency and Honesty: Be open, transparent, honest]]
I would definitely involve external actors earlier in the process of our portfolio because we did a very internal work within our CEO to define the theme of social cohesion, which was a very long process\. But I also understand the why we did not do it\. We were in a very complicated political environments pre election, then very heavy social protest at the end of last year, and then we just had election at the beginning of this year\. So let's say that we've had about 12 months of uncertainty in a political level\. So it was why the decision was taken not to involve the ministries and the and the governmental actors earlier in the process, because we were kind of waiting for this new administration now to come in and then bring them on the work\. So if I had to do it again, I would have involved them earlier\.

## [[8:50]] Great\. Do you think you already reached the face of deficient and catalyzation?

[[tactics:Getting in there (positioning the lab in UNDP prodoc)]]
[[principles:Even when the Lab is not there (or UNDP) things should continue - we have tâ€¦]]
[[tools:Collective Intelligence]]
[[tactics:Designing the pipelines]]
I think we are starting, we are starting to, we are starting to, to do it\. And, and I think it is happening through this demand from our CEO\. We're now using this AI methodology on another process, which is with two other agencies with UNODC and UNFPA\. We're working on a project on gun control in high schools in the city in Panama, and they've asked us to embed our AI methodology in that that project\. So we're seeing how the methods of the lab are being diffused and catalyzed in this sense\. Do you get involved some others policy makers for example for diffusion and catalyzation is the idea to a private sector and others\. Right now we're reaching to local governments mostly more than like a country and national governments\. We're trying to get working with territories\. So we already have several meetings with new local government that were recently elected and the idea is to diffuse and catalyze through this lower level of government and then work our way back up towards policy changes\.

## [[10:11]] Yeah\. OK\. So my last question will be, are you proud of this job you've done so far?

Yes, of course\.

## [[10:19]] What the your environment think about it?

[[principles:Human centering and adaptability: Less of me, more of them]]
[[principles:Recognize local expertise : Nothing for us, without us]]
[[principles:Recognize and promote agency: Enable agency, the greatest choice for the greatest number]]
[[principles:Disruptiveness]]
I'm very proud of the work we've done so far because I think that if one thing is very hard is to change people's habits\. We've done a lot of work on social behaviour change within the labs and we know it's a thing that takes a lot of time\. But what we are seeing is that within our country office, we're seeing a change of mindset where people are thinking more systemically and are really opening their minds towards not the usual siloed one way to approach things, but like, OK, there's many ways we can enter this problem\. We can involve different styles of actors\. So this is for me a very impressive result in almost change management know how we've impacted the way the traditional UNDP way of working is being done\. And I think that working in a more systemic way and I don't want to quote our administrator, Akim Steiner, but it's the only way towards the efficiency and toward reaching the SD GS\.

### [[11:28]] Thank you\.\_\_

Thank you, Mahama\.
