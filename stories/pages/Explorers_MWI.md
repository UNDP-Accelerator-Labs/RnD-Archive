# AI for Tourism Innovation in Malawi

### [[0:01]] So hi, thank you for joining me today\. I just wanted to know what was your name and what was your role and where are you from?

So my name is McDonald Gnioni, I am the Head of Exploration for the accident lab in Malawi\.

### [[0:15]] Amazing\. Well, welcome\. Thank you for taking time today\. I just wanted to ask you, would you be able to share an R&D activity that you've been doing? How did come about or where did it start?

So in Malawi the government has been making a trans like a transition from the Vision 2020 to Vision 2063 that prompted a new way of working but also new targets and new focus areas unlike what UNDP focuses in Malawi\.  
The new areas where agriculture, tourism and mining, which the UNTP Malawi does not work with apart from some partial projects in agriculture\.  
The RR then made a few colleagues in New York and the way she He learned more about AI and how AI could be used in different developmental endeavors\.  
And he inspired us to say, could you explore how AI could be used to the new ways of working so that it could become our entry points in some of these areas so that we see what UNDP could be able to do\.  
That inspiration took us into a journey of looking into what we could do with the AI\.  
And what we did was to explore how to infuse AI into tourism, leading into now the development of AI for tourism in Malawi\.  
So AI is the main issue, is the main tool that we were using, trying to understand the sentiment analysis of people within Malawi beat the owners of the establishments, but also the tourists themselves\.  
And by understanding this, we'll be able to create now insights into how to develop the industry better because it's an industry that is the third one in terms of contributing to the national GDP, but it is lurse invested in\.  
But there's a lot of potential\.  
So the insights would also help in terms of investment on how to invest in in the in tourism, but also it would help in terms of how to develop the whole ecosystem, be it players, but also the infrastructure in Malawi\.  
So that has been the R&D that we've been doing trying to understand tourism through the lens of AI\.

### [[2:36]] What an amazing topic that that's going to be a like, I love that topic\. So who are the stakeholders and partners that you have in this AI for tourism?

[[principles:Recognize local expertise /Knowledge is produced from below: Nothing for us, without us]]
[[tactics:Understanding the Community]]
So the stakeholders we have for this initiative is the Ministry of Tourism\.  
That's the primary stakeholder because from the onset, we made sure that if we have to get sustainability, we need to ensure that the ministry, which is a policy holder for this initiative, is part of this conversation, but also holds the product at the end of the day\.  
So the ministry is a primary stakeholder\.  
We have other ministries supporting that\.  
Now we have the Minister of Finance, which has the National Statistics Office to make sure that we get the data\.  
We have through the government, the Ministry of the President, it was also involved because of the issue of innovation that are also part of the project\.  
And we have now other external stockholders now from the private sector\.  
We have banks involved because of the revenue element that is part of the conversation, but also the insights that they want to get from this AI\.  
We also have establishments, tourist operators from hotels, areas of attractions, events, car rental companies and so forth\.  
And these are all stakeholders coming together to explore how tour, how tourists would benefit from AI as a product that will revolutionize how to invest, but also how to get insights for development\.

### [[4:04]] It's amazing such a big ecosystem\. How did you think their insight or like what do you think their input has shaped in terms of your R&D journey?

[[skills:Collective intelligence, video, visibility was key success, "press advisor"]]
When we started this journey of exploring AI into tourism, our thought was more to do with we just need data\.  
When we get the data, we'll be able to get the insights\.  
When we were talking to the community, the discussion was different\.  
There are issues, no data\.  
Their issue is we are dealing with awkward systems that are not connected to each other and that has a bearing to our product and we need support to make sure that you help us to organize the the ecosystem\.  
What are these systems?  
The system is about the ministry staying alone in one space without talking to different stakeholders who are also need to have a say in how development has to be done\.  
Of course, to an extent, if you look at it by extension, data is very important\.  
If all these people have data, they would be talking to each other\.  
But the first thing is the relationship\.  
Would you be able to build the relationship between these two sectors, stakeholders?  
That's 1\-2\.  
We thought the problem is just we are lacking data\.  
But the actual problem these people are dealing with is infrastructure development is the quality of service\.  
And the quality of service has a building with the tax they're supposed to pay\.  
If they're paying a lot of tax, they can't give you good quality at at at an affordable rate\.  
So you're dealing with some structure issues that needs the stakeholder, the stakeholder to be together to discuss\.  
Because at the end of the day, the data will still point out to the same issues and how are you going to deal with them?  
You need these stakeholders to start talking\.  
So this, this was an interesting thing where we found ourselves talking to these stakeholders and also realizing that by talking to them by the collective intelligence that we're engaging them\.  
The hackathon that we had to try to find the issues, to look into the drivers of the issues, the data sources, we found that the issue is much bigger than we thought\.  
And it was quite an interesting journey\.

### [[6:05]] Nice\. Well, thanks for sharing\. I hear collective intelligence, I hear crowdsourcing, I think\. So I guess these are tools and methods would you say like what are, are these the tools and methods that you use Are there any more else that you use in terms of this project, what we started with was the generic UNDP set up of a project which we which was to do an inception meeting\.

[[skills:Making insights actionable]]
[[principles:Collaboration]]
[[skills:Collective intelligence, video, visibility was key success, "press advisor"]]
[[principles:Transparency]]
[[tools:Collective intelligence]]
[[tools:NESTA's Collective Intelligence Design Playbook]]
[[principles:Collaboration]]
[[skills:Making insights actionable]]
So we did an inception meeting where we had the ministry as a primary policy holder, but also other stakeholders, private but also other public stakeholders, public sector stockholders\.  
When they all come together, we discussed, we share the vision, they had questions, they put it into, they had to do an input into our our concept, which we refined the concept and then we moved into now the hackathon\.  
So we hackathon is, is another tool that we used to engage\.  
And as part of the hackathon, we did a lot of collective intelligence through that and that led into further discussions with different stakeholders going forward to to more or less like confirm the findings of the hackathon\.  
And that was also another session where we did other other back and forth via our virtual engagement\.

### [[7:22]] Awesome\.b It seems a little bit related to the tactics and approaches to engage stakeholders, right, Like the hackathons are there is what are the approaches and tactics that you used sort of to engage your stakeholders?

[[tools:Scaling partnerships by demonstrating value incrementally]]
[[principles:Never deplete social capital, always increase social capital]]
[[principles:Partnership]]
[[principles:Risk analysis and trust from stakeholders]]
So we already understood that they the sector was a bit fragmented in terms of the relationship between the private and public sector, because this is an industry that is characterized by money\.  
There are transactions happening\.  
And in most of the times in these industries, you have issues of tags, you have issues of infrastructure support and so forth\.  
You have incentives that people are looking for, you have issues of pricing\.  
So you have all these things happening\.  
So we already understood that it's a, it's a bit of a fragile sector to engage in\.  
So for us, we, we had to find tactics of how do we best bring all the stakeholders in one place, but make sure that the discussion should be productive\.  
And what we did was to make sure that we have engagements beforehand, but also over communicate\.  
So we did a lot of communication\.  
So we started with the inception, we started with a concept\.  
We had a core online with all the stakeholders we had to gauge so that we listened to the inputs through this virtual engagement, which is safe because you can simply mute someone and then see what the what were the issues that were coming in and make sure that we address them beforehand before the in person meeting\.  
So that way the taxes were we're trying to get to make sure that we have, we also get the benefits, but also we made sure that we listen because some of the times as development partners, we speak more than we, we should listen\.  
So we had, we make sure that we listen\.  
So we allow people to speak so they speak their mind, we noted, speak their mind, we noted\.  
And we're trying to understand what is the position, what is the bottom line, what is the source of this either disappointment or excitement in this industry\.  
And we had to use that to frame our engagement for the hackathon, which lead to a better engagement later on\.  
So those are the tactics that we have to use\.
[[skills:Collective intelligence, video, visibility was key success, "press advisor"]]
[[skills:Cultural Adaptability]]
[[skills:Facilitation skills]]
[[skills:Communication, partnership, public relations]]

### [[9:3]] It actually also now relates a bit to the skills because I hear like communication over communication is one of the things that you raised\. What were the skills that were needed for this kind of R&D or to address the challenges that you faced or the needs of the your R&D initiative?

[[skills:Negotiation]]
[[skills:Sharing Knowledge, training, and unusual partnership]]
[[principles:Partnership]]
[[tactics:Based on petition, get the message to the right person]]
Yeah, these skills I would point out to negotiation\.  
Negotiation is one of the skills that you need specifically if you are working in a, in a sector that involves money and there's, there's a private sector, there's a public sector interest in that because it has a bearing to 1 taxes, which the government, the private, the public sector is looking for\.  
But also it has money and business growth that the private sector is looking for\.  
So you have to find a way how to negotiate this conversation to drive it towards, to the development that will benefit all\.  
And another thing is making sure that the benefits are being front loaded to the people\.  
So what are the what are the benefits to the public sector?  
What are the best benefits to the to the to the private sector?  
When this is front load to the people, It's easy and it's a good skill to make sure that you front load and you make sure that you convince people\.  
So this is what you need to why you need to be part of this conversation because it's going to help you this way\.  
And I think that is interesting is also context, context understanding and cost\.  
Context mastery is one of the skills that is very important\.  
And kudos to the structure of Accelerator Lab is that everyone that is working in the country has to be from that country\.  
Context is very important\.  
I would say this because one, if you're talking to people, you also understand the local dynamics\.  
And these are the people that you grew up with, some of them professionally, but also maybe in the region that you come from\.  
And it's easy to also understand what is happening within the country and try to mirror it and find a common ground for all\.  
Another skill that was important for this task and the last one is understanding of technology\.  
We're talk of artificial intelligence Malawi penetration of Internet right now, if I'm not mistaken, is around 30 something percent, right?  
That's Internet penetration\.  
And we're looking at a lot of people who are not connected\.  
And there's so many issues there\.  
So if you're talking about artificial intelligence, you need to understand how to communicate that animal\.  
I'll tell you a story\.  
When I was, we were doing the inception meeting, one of the tourist operators has a place where you could see animals\.  
You could see you could have experiences\.  
Ask me a question, I say\.  
So you're talking about artificial intelligence\.  
Are you going to help my tourist to be able to locate where the lion is in my in the jungle?  
Because if they come, we have to wait and we have to look for the lion within the jungle\.  
Could the artificial intelligence locate so that when they come, this goes straight and see the lion?  
So these were the issues that people are thinking about\.  
It's possible you could do you, you could tag the animal with some sensors and so forth, but you're thinking that this is what they're looking after because they're looking at what their benefit\.  
So you have to address, you have to think about how technology addresses these needs, but it's about the skill of understanding the technology and explain the steps within technology\.

[[tools:Scenario analysis]]
[[tools:Design Thinking (for public innovation)]]
[[tools:User Journey Mapping - Design Thinking]]

### [[12:51]] Absolutely\. Great story actually\. Like I would have not thought about that\. But it is impossible like maybe some sensors like you said, or remote sensing or imagery to see where they're moving\.I had to wait\. I was in Tanzania, Kenya and with the migration and I had to wait for them to come\. And you know, so anyways, in terms of the principles, like in terms of how you design this, like your AI for tourism initiative, what were sort of the principles that you guys were like, you know, this should be embedded in the design of our, our initiative\.

[[tools:Innovative approach - Design Thinking - Issue Mapping - Stakeholder Mapping]]
[[principles:Recognize local expertise /Knowledge is produced from below: Nothing for us, without us]]
[[principles:Accessibility of knowledge]]
[[skills:System analysis and complex design]]
The 1st, the 1st principle is systems\.  
The systems thinking has to be part of the offer\.  
It is a very important because when you're talking to government stakeholders, the first thing they will ask is how they want to understand how, how, how in how close are you to understanding the sector\.  
And if you don't use systems, systems understanding, it will be difficult for you to even explain how the the sector is governed, how the sector is organized\.  
And if you don't understand that, understanding the big pieces that are moving within the system, within the sector, which is essentially the system, understanding who is there, who is that, who's doing what,  
And that will be a problem in terms of the solution\.  
So you could take time, two years, three years to design a solution, but that solution would not have a benefit for them\.  
Another principle is inclusion\.  
One of the issues that you would find in places like Malawi is people that would not understand the basic terms we talk of AI\.  
They'll be like, OK, fine, what is AI?  
You're like maybe the popular ChatGPT that is there\.  
In the meantime, be like, what is ChatGPT?  
All right, haven't you heard of people typing asking some an AI this and they will respond\.  
Now I've never heard of that\.  
So you need to start from OK, fine, let's talk of computers\.  
Do you know a computer?  
Like yeah, I know a computer\.  
Do you know a phone or?  
OK, fine, how do these things connect?  
I don't know\.  
OK, fine\.  
No, they are, we're talking of networks\.  
OK, there's a tower, OK, you can connect from this and there's Internet\.  
It's a global thing\.  
So it's about you understanding the basics and be able to be inclusive to people because these are the people that have money, they have invested overtime, they have establishments and these establishments are the ones that you have to work with if you have to have an effective program, if you're doing tourism and focusing on air\.  
So it's the inclusion\.  
The principle of inclusion has to be embedded in the design\.  
And, and I also mentioned the principle of systems has to be embedded for you to understand how to connect the dots\.

[[skills:Management: People, project, consultants, self, and financials]]
[[tools:From Insights to Impact:  Storytelling for Renewable Energy Solutions]]
[[skills:Management: People, project, consultants, self, and financials]]

### [[15:36]] Absolutely\. Two very good recipes for success there\. So let's reflect on the journey\. So where are you like what, what are the outcomes or impacts that you've seen so far?

[[principles:Ingenuity]]
[[principles:Disruptiveness]]
[[tactics:Design the narrative flow and the stage to ensure the community and the desired outcome lead]]
[[tools:Co-Creation and Validation of Improvement Interventions]]
So the immediate outcomes that we have seen is that we have bailed traction because of starting this project in initiative, the R&D journey, engaging the minister and all the stakeholders in this inception meeting\.  
And we went into hackathon and we did the validation exercise to understand the results from the hackathon\.  
And then we started the development, going through different splints to develop the 1st, the 1st splint and then and then take the, the, the potential users in a journey to soccer\.  
This is what is happening\.  
Then giving feedback and so forth\.  
We have learnt a lot, a lot in terms of you could build traction even if the project is not at the final stage\.  
And that's a very important need that accelerator brings in a country\.  
So where you don't work, you're work you, you can have an outcome in two days and you use that to build something in Malawi\.  
As part of our support to the Minister of Tourism through this R&D journey for activation agency, we have seen that the Ministry is now excited to apply for other opportunities in line with digitalization\.  
So they applied for an opportunity within UNDP and they got 40,000 U\.S\.  
dollars to help them to build the first iteration of a system, an AMI system that will help them to digitize most of the assets, most of their data\.  
You'll be surprised to hear that in Malawi more all of the data from the Minister of Tourism is manual is offline\.  
So if you come, you have to sign a form and that form has to go to if you are even you go to a hotel, that hotel has to sign something and all that paperwork has to go to the ministry and you have this whole room\.  
It is big with paperwork and if they want to make an analysis, they just have to get here random sampling and after random somebody that you know, get something there, get a paper there, get a paper there, few papers analyze that and make a, a conclusion of that\.  
But you know, that's not how data is supposed to be understood\.  
Data is vast and you have to think about so many sources, but it's difficult because everything is offline\.  
And this initiative supported them, helped them to now see, because when we're trying to look into the data sources for AI for tourism, we were looking at booking\.com, we're looking at TripAdvisor, and now we're looking at Airbnb, because these are the already existing data sources and the alternative data sources\.  
When we asked, do you have any data, any data that is lying around that we could use like we don't have?  
And that helped them\.  
So there's a need and they applied they got it and they are working on that one, which will help this AI later on to have now domestic data that is easy to trust\.
[[principles:Inclusivity and diversity]]
[[tools:Quasi Experimental Design Processes]]
[[tools:This inventory is about how you can use experiments to solve public and soc…]]
[[principles:Deep listening to map beyond the tangible: Listen deep and show you are listening]]

### [[18:30]] Amazing\. You definitely filled the gap there\. Random sampling in that way is pretty like dangerous\. Yes, dangerous in terms of learnings, let's say\. Would you have done anything differently if you were to do it again?

[[tactics:Design the narrative flow and the stage to ensure the community and the desired outcome lead]]
[[skills:Sharing Knowledge, training, and unusual partnership]]
[[principles:Recognize and promote agency: Enable agency, the greatest choice for the greatest number]]
[[tools:Increasing community engagement through community-growing incentives]]
If we're to do it again, I think two things or start again\.  
If we go start at like if we go to start it again, there are two things that I I can record my now that we could have done differently\.  
The first one is we could have made sure that we we have champions within the Ministry of Tourism\.  
You know, one of the things that I have learned over time is that change is negotiations\.  
You have to find someone who advocates for you within the particular organization\.  
If you don't have someone, you speak to random people and you don't have something landing in that organization\.  
So to have champions in the private sector, champions within the ministry from the would go would have been very important to help us to move quickly on some other things\.  
Now we are developing the Champions as part of the leanings to make sure that we have champions in the in the public sector as we're champions in the private sector\.  
Another thing I could have done easily, like like Beta, if we're to do this again, is the, the choice of, of teams to work with\.  
Because within the organization, within UNTP, you have people that have resources and sometimes they don't just understand that you need to, they need to partner with you to advance their own agendas\.  
They, our agendas are the same\.  
We just want to end poverty in Malawi\.  
That's the focus\.  
Poverty alleviation\.  
We are working on the same\.  
So we're trying to work with a different agency, a different unit within the organization, which are not mentioned because it's recorded\.  
But they didn't help us\.  
At the end of the day, they promised us, OK, we'll work together or we'll add money into your plan so that we make it bigger\.  
But they never came through\.  
The people that came through is a different unit\.  
If we could have opened up the partnership within the organization, OK, everyone who's happy to work with us, come and work with us, we could have gotten these people that we're working with now that some of these agents, some of these departments earlier on and that could have helped us to move quickly\.

[[skills:Sharing Knowledge, training, and unusual partnership]]
[[tactics:Based on petition, get the message to the right person]]

### [[20:53]] Excellent\. I think you also touched on the next one already with your answer, which is like the diffusion and the catalyzation\. I think that's the last question\. So what strategies and approaches did you employ to facilitate the adoption of these R&D outcomes? I heard a little bit like the Champions, right, like champions enable you to have faster adoption\. So you could tell me more about that or if there's any other tactics that you are trying to do right now as well apart from the Champions\.

[[tools:Scaling partnerships by demonstrating value incrementally]]
[[tools:Collaborative design of actions]]
[[skills:Making insights actionable]]
[[principles:Recognize local expertise /Knowledge is produced from below: Nothing for us, without us]]
All right\.  
So yes, champions is the first thing that we're trying to do as part of us telling the story of impact and making sure that other people carry that message and it's easier for us to scale through them\.  
It's one tool is how we are making sure that we are pushing the value to these different sections, the public sector, but also the private sector\.  
So for us, we want to make sure, we are trying to make sure that they also, they all understand for the ministry to help them to get insights which will help them in policy, but also help them in terms of how they can find rise\.  
I forgot to mention that when we're having this conversation earlier on, we invited some of the donors like EU and EU, hearing of what we're trying to do with the Minister of Tourism with AI\.  
They were like, no, this is amazing\.  
I think this will revolutionize the the sector itself\.  
And due to it's driving a lot of interest because we, we're failing to support them because there's no data that is helping us to understand these infrastructure inges, these statement analysis issues that people that would come together to help us to know what is happening in the industry and for us to help\.  
So it's about what will the public sector get and what, what, what will this private sector get?  
And the private sector is about understanding their customer and making sure that they make these changes, these developments to help allow to be an attractive destination and that will help them\.  
So for us to catalyze, we are trying to make sure that there is, it's not like we are branching it and remove and, and making it different, but we're just making sure that everyone is aware and everyone is already interested\.  
OK, fine\.  
If we were to carry this, if we were to make sure that this is sustainable, we have to work on it because this is what will benefit\.  
So our tactic, our strategy to make sure that we expand is that internally within the organization, we have made sure that different units are involved\.  
So from the policy unit, because the insights that will be picked from this AI will help in, in, in, in policy in one way or the other as the ministry is thinking about changes and so forth\.  
And a few weeks ago, we took the governance meeting the governance, a few weeks ago, we took the governance department within Malawi, it's called portfolio now and the accelerator\.  
But we went together to the minister of tourism to say, we want to make sure that we are aligning\.  
So that alignment already has strands\.  
And some of the strands are one\.  
We need to think about policy\.  
How will this insider will get from this AI informed policy, but also how will this inform maybe a few strategies within the within the within the the ministry as just an organization itself, but also how are we going to move forward in terms of these changes if they are deployed within the country?  
Another way of defusing for us is working out loud\.  
We are trying to make sure that we are making nice about this product so that people that are interested to pick it up\.  
I was talking to GIZ another day because GIZ is also investing in tourism and Malawi and they're excited\.  
So no, we were only investing in ecotourism\.  
But we think if this tool is there, it helps us to have insights\.  
Because for us, ecotourism, it is easy\.  
We just go to people establishments, do manual data collection and analyze and be able to do some support\.  
But if we're able to get data now from the high end establishments like the hotels and so forth that is coming in daily, weekly, monthly, we could be able to intervene\.  
So already we're building traction, and that traction could be how we're going to expand this\.  
Beyond this, the idea and the wish for accelerator is if we develop a product that is viable for the private sector and the public sector and even the donor community, we could have a product that would support itself but also could create some governance on itself\.  
And that will be how it grows and helps the industry to be better and helping sustainable development\.

### [[25:38]] Amazing\. Well, thank you so much for telling your story to me\. I've learned so much and it's been amazing\. And good luck with this project\. I think it's gonna take off amazingly, particularly you have so much adoption mechanisms for the government\. So I wish you all the luck and hope to see you soon\.

Thank you\.

Thank you so much\.  
Appreciate it\.
