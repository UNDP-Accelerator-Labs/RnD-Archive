[[0:00]] Hi, my name is Omagano Kankondi\. I'm the Head of Solutions Mapping for the Namibian Accelerator Lab\.

### [[0:07]] Tell us about an R&D story and start by telling us the title of that story\.

Alright\. So it's some work that we did in the informal sector\. So really focusing on e\-commerce, digitalization and streamlining a few processes for some of the vendors that we worked with in the informal sector\. So the work started in 2020 when we were about to go into the lockdown and there was a conversation around informal vendors\. What will happen to them when we go into a lockdown? They depend on foot traffic\. So how can we ensure that there's money in their pocket during this time? And around that time, we connected with a innovator called Jerobium and he was working on a platform, e\-commerce platform called Tambula\. At that time there weren't really many or well known e\-commerce platforms in Namibia\. So we linked up with him and asked if we could if he could develop or create an informal market on his platform\. So the idea really was to work with some of a few vendors, 20 at the time that were that worked in an area called client Vento where they were just working like they had fruit stalls\. And since the food was perishable, we like, OK, let's start with them and see how we can assist them to get money in their pockets\. So we set up a partnership with Jerobium and under Tambola\. And what we did is we uploaded about 20 of these vendors on them\. The process was very linear\. You as the customer go onto the platform, you order your food\. The Tambola team goes to the vendor because they now have a personal relationship, picks up the goods and brings it to you, delivers it to you\. At that time, the Tambola team, they were part of the essential worker, so she could, they could actually move around freely\. So it was very linear\. The processes, the payment methods were from every bank that is in Namibia, every electronic wallet that's available in Namibia or cash, credit card, debit card, any of that\. So it was easy for people to pay that\. That was the beginning\. That was the initial stages and we didn't really know how far it would go\. Then as part of the evolution in phase two, we were approached by a financial institution called Old Mutual\. They had a project called OM Seed, which was looking at providing seed capital for grassroot innovators or yeah, most people trading informally\. So we joined up with, we collaborated with him and the initial part of this, this initiative with him is they would have pitching context content, yeah, around the, around the country and find 3 winners from the different regions\. So I think we had about 1212 winners\. So what we did is with those winners, we then they wanted us to train them and we didn't want to do like the very, like the presentation style training\. So we developed a first of its kind incubation program for informal vendors specifically in Namibia\. It was about 10 weeks\. So what we did now from OMCD is those vendors came into this training and then from this training they were uploaded onto the, yeah, the onboarded onto Tambola\. So that was our way now of making sure we can get vendors that we have verified\. We know what their products are\. We know that they they've got capacity and on top of that they've got seed capital now to actually assist them if we don't have enough within our budget to assist them\. So that was phase two and then with phase three of this that they that evolution, we wanted to train them when it comes to digitalization because fine, they're benefiting from being on an EE e\-commerce platform without having any additive devices\. But now we want to be OK, we should be able to help them maneuver these platforms if you want them to continue, continue benefiting long term\. So we partnered with a mobile telecommunication company, the biggest one in Namibia\. They provided cell phones, very entry level smartphones\. Then we revamped the e\-commerce platform where each vendor now had their own storefront that they operated\. And then obviously that came in parallel to that\. We were also training them how to do this\. So whole training and utilization\.


### [[4:31]] Yeah, good\. Thank you for that\. What skills do you say maybe you guys had to use for this R&D tool method? Tell us the skills you used you had to engage for this learning cycle, 

[[tactics:Systems thinking]]
[[principles:Immersion and engagemen]]
[[principles:Human centering and adaptability]]
[[principles:Adaptability]]
OK, the whole process, Yeah, OK\. A lot of it also was we had to learn how to develop curriculum, right\. It's something weren't really familiar with\. So developing curriculum, facilitating specifically to a specific target audience that maybe we would not work with, especially in this training, training space for myself specifically\. It's more, you know, when you go to private sector and to get their buy in that kind of negotiation, building that up and yeah, like really trying to plump that up\. So negotiation, training, facilitating curriculum development\. Yeah, I think those were the key ones\. Those are the ones that come top of mind\.


### [[5:37]] OK, thank you\. Where did you have to pivot, change course, try out a new tactic to get things moving, get people on ward? Tell us a bit about that\.

[[tactics:Undertanding the community]]
[[tactics:Getting in there]]
[[tools:Innovation challenge]]
[[tactics:Co-design]]
When or where, when, when after phase one, after phase one, when we're like OK, this is great\. The initial time was really for COVID, but there was moment people had now gotten to know Tambula and how do we keep this going? How do we continue to help? Because now the vendors are back on the on the by their, by their locations, right? So that initial thing has gone\. So how do we keep this going? That's where while we were busy trying to figure out what to do, how to do it, this partnership opportunity came up with Old Mutual and that was enough for us now to, to allow us to pivot\. That was a, because now we could go into the training because the first group we didn't train\. So we realised that if we can capacitate them and train them, that is more long lasting than just putting them on the, on the, on the platform\. And we also had to create value for them and also make them stand out so people will be willing to actually go to the platform\. So that's where the first pivot happened to, to move into training, 2nd pivot was into a more it's capacitating them now so that they can on the e\-commerce platform, they are able to operate it themselves\. So there were 33 before each evolution\.


### [[7:06]] OK\. So I think something interesting related to what you're talking about would be who was involved in that in this journey, like talk about stakeholders, like key partners and how did they help like bring this to fruition\.

[[tactics:Gaining leverage and traction for solutions]]
[[tactics:Allies and champions]]
[[principles:Recognize and promote agency]]
[[tactics:Asset mapping]]
So one of our obviously the platform that we couldn't do anything without them\. Then we had the Namibia Informal Sector Organization where they are the umbrella body for the unions and all the other groups that collect, you know, where informal vendors or participants are, you know, collected\. So with them we could get a better understanding of where the vendors were, where are the markets, who is in which market, who sells what, in which market, who have they worked with that, you know, trustworthy, trusted or you know, just who would they suggest, you know, and guide us in this space because we'd never really never get with the space at this level, you know, So that was the informal sector organization\. Then we also private sector with MTC, which is not the mobile telecommunication company that I was talking about because they have a CSI program and these smartphones that they provided, they're just, they're specific to underprivileged people or people who are not able to get like a smartphone on their own really at the prices that smartphones really are sold\. So it's for good cause that was MTC, then Old Mutual, the financial service because they came on board as providing seed capital\. We had the Ministry of Trade as well because if we're working in that space, we also need to have partnership with the Ministry of Trade\. We also had Impact Tank\. Impact Tank is a venture builder, the first venture builder in Namibia\. So these are the main partners that we had\. Impact Tank was also bringing capacity and training, assisting us with the curriculum development and so forth\. So each of these had a really key role\.


### [[9:05]] OK, thanks for that\. So tell me more about now kind of wrapping up, how did, how did this diffuse? Like how did this go on to be implemented? Maybe scaled catalyzed? How would you say the journey went?

[[tactics:Desiging the pipelines]]
[[principles:Flexibility and adaptability]]
[[tools:Design]]
[[tools:Quasi expermental design processes]]
So the journey it was, it's difficult to actually say because it kind of happened organically\. We didn't actually, our pace was going to be a bit slower than the way it actually happened\. Because you know, with projects and everything, you want this, you want the conditions to be as perfect as possible for you or what looks like perfect\. But because of all the different partners that are in place and creating momentum on their own, the combined momentum move faster and more organically than anticipated\. But when it comes to diffusion, it's what I'd like to show me\. There were so many spin offs for on policy level and if I start speaking about policy level, because of this work that we started doing with the informal sector, we were working with the Namibia Informal sector organization\. We commissioned a diagnostic study of the informal sector across all 14 regions that ended up having a policy\. We created a policy brief from them that now went into to give some input into the draft of the MSN ME and informal sector policy that's currently on table now\. So that's policy level\. Then from the digital side speaking, we ended up speaking with the Ministry of Information, MI, CT Communication and Technology\. We're developing the national digital strategy, which we worked with the ministry impact tank and the lab as well\. We made sure that all this that we've learned from the work that we've done with the informal sector has been included in these strategic documents\. So that part has gone\. I guess you could say that's diffusion on that level\. When it comes to the adoption of Tambula, that was a little bit harder\. There was a lot of, there was a lot of marketing involved\. There was a lot of that\. There was a lot of buying, getting champions on board for it to be popularized\. And it so happened that, you know, the minister of Trade, yeah, the Minister of Trade, Miss Lucia King, who actually became a champion for that\. And then that's on that level because we had that backing from the ministry\. It made it a little bit easier\. Yeah\. So we had strong partnerships that allowed for this actually\.


### [[11:40]] Did anything that happened during the journey change your mind? Can you tell me more about how that happened?

[[principles:Trust]]
[[principles:Self-awareness]]
[[principles:Human centering and adaptability]]
[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
Yes, it did\. Because some of us, we have preconceptions of what the informal sector looks like, what they want to learn, what they don't want to learn, what they want to be involved in\. And it was that it opened up my mind even more that when it comes to digitalization, they are fully on board\. They just wanted to speak to them\. So it I had a lot of preconceptions that I had to like really squash\. So yeah, it did change my mind a lot about how we engage in our assumptions when we're going to specific space that we assume we know\.


### [[12:19]] What would you do differently if you had to start again?

[[principles:Always increase social capital]]
[[tactics:Systems thinking]]
[[tactics:Desiging the pipelines]]
[[tools:Design]]
I think if we had to start again, especially after we realized when we started after phase one, it would, it would be to mobilize more resources and not just to depend on what we had\. Because it becomes very easy to just depend on what you have\. Because when you go try and get money from other places, it can the process you can lose momentum\. So I wish, yeah, next time I would have wanted to mobilize more resources after phase one that brought on more partners from the regions because what ended up happening is we were affecting people outside of the Vintuk region because initially like when we started was for Vintuk\. So brought in more partners from the regional, regional counselors, unions from the regions\. But yeah, those would be the two main thing, partnerships and resources\.


### [[13:16]] OK, Thank you so much for sharing that experience with us\. Super useful\.

Thank you\.
