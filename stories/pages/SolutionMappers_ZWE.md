## [[0:00]] Hello\.

Hello\.

## [[0:02]] Thank you for this little interview\. My name is Eneida\. I work at Angola country office\. Please tell us your name and the country that you have come from\.

I'm Charlene Moyo\. I'm the head of solutions mapping at UNDP Zimbabwe\.

## [[0:21]] Thank you, Charlene\. So could you just tell us a story about R&D that your country office are working on or already work?

OK\. So in 2021, we had the issue of COVID\-19 and how it was affecting trade for cross\-border traders\. And what was happening is that they couldn't move their goods across borders\. So to help women to have business continuity as the Accelerator lab, we try to find a way to understand how we can make, you know, their businesses run again so that they don't lose, you know, their, their dignity in terms of not having access to, to, to, to, you know, a salary or anything of that sort\. So the first thing that we did was to try and understand what it was that they were facing in terms of challenges\. And for us to do that, we decided to do a community immersion process\. This involved the accelerator lab and also volunteers that we'd hired going into a city, a border town city called Victoria Falls, and trying to understand by immersing ourselves in that community, what the challenges were\. Some of the things that we also had to consider was the issue of culture, the issue of languages spoken and to see how women want to, you know, express themselves\. OK\. So to do that we actually did a situational analysis of the area of Victoria Falls and we realized that we had to understand Guni languages and Guni culture\. So from that perspective, the volunteers who we asked to help us engage the women could now speak to them in in their language where they could freely express themselves in terms of the challenges that they face\. And even within the communities when they were working, when they were, you know, doing their day\-to\-day tasks, we were then able to gather what a day in the life of a woman who engages in cross\-border trade used to do and then what their life was like after COVID\-19\.

## [[3:19]] OK, great, great\. Charming to do this this kind of work\. What do you think it's the key skills that you need for this kind of work?

[[principles:Deep listening to map beyond the tangible: Listen deep and show you are listening]]
[[principles:Human centering and adaptability: Less of me, more of them]]
[[principles:Deep listening to map beyond the tangible:]]
[[principles:Transparency and Honesty: Be open, transparent, honest]]
OK, in our situation, we learnt through the community immersion process that you have to engage in deep listening and active listening in that it goes to listening to what is said, what is not said\. Also trying to understand the emotions that are conveyed when someone is telling you their challenges\. We felt that by doing that we, it gave us signals in terms of the areas to help the, the women in cross\-border trade\. So when we, we actually did that, we started finding out that the, the major issue that they had was that they didn't have the, the border passes that would allow them to cross the border anymore\. They had to use their passports, and passports are expensive in our country\. So they were asking if, you know, we as a accelerator lab could act as a convener of City Council and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to, say, allow women to still have boarding passes so that they can buy goods without having to have a passport used\.

## [[4:56]] Wow\. All right, don't move\. It might as well be, yeah, yeah, it's good, but it's correct If I corrected, it's going to get better\.

OK\.

## [[5:09]] Oh, perfect\. Continue\. OK\. So again, as far as I understand, it was work that you did with other stakeholders\. You do other partners who you involve in this work, OK\. Who are your partners in in terms of this work?

When we were trying to work with the women, we looked at the fact that most of them were part of cross\-border trader associations and the spaces that they used to sell their goods and to transport their goods were part of the Victoria Falls City Council\. So we also had to engage the City Council when it came to assisting in terms of getting goods across the border\. We then also had to engage the customs and taxes authority\. And then also because of the fact that they had to use their passports all the time, we also had to involve the immigration\. And then the last one that we also had to involve was the Ministry of Health, because at that time, besides the expense of maybe your passport running out of space, there was also the expense of the COVID\-19 test\. So we had to bring those stakeholders around the table and help them explain that the quality of life of the women had changed because there were so many competing expenses that were now coming up for them to be able to trade\. It was easy to put all those partners together or there is some critical moments that it took some time, I think because we couldn't move that much because of COVID\-19\. So what we relied on was WhatsApp groups\. Funny enough, because we realized that the rate of response on WhatsApp groups was faster than trying to put it on e\-mail where someone would have to try and go to an office to understand when meetings happening\. What is it that you're trying to gather? So we ended up using WhatsApp\.

## [[7:39]] OK, So you try to understand the communication tool that's more effective for your audience and you talk about this to understand the culture\.

[[tactics:Understanding the Community]]
[[principles:Human centering and adaptability: Less of me, more of them]]
[[principles:Recognize local expertise: Nothing for us, without us]]
[[principles:Transparency and Honesty: Be open, transparent, honest]]
No, it was difficult to understand the, the culture and to engage with these communities or it was quite easy\. I mean it was, it took some time because we had to build trust\. The area that we were working in had had some issues historically where, you know, they were known issues between tribes\. So the tribes that are within this area, Matavelin Province, they sometimes feel like they're the minority\. So what we tried to do for them to open up was to look for volunteers who understood the context to, to help them feel safe in them expressing some of the challenges that they were facing\. So we didn't prescribe per se, but we first looked at the community to see if we could find volunteers who reflect what they understand\.

## [[9:03]] Yeah, it's, it seems to me a very rich experience\. So what are the main impact that you see in the work that you have done and the kill lesson learn that you can bring, you can share with us\.

[[principles:Recognize and promote agency: Enable agency, the greatest choice for the greatest number]]
[[principles:Recognize local expertise: Nothing for us, without us]]
[[principles:Even when the Lab is not there (or UNDP) things should continue - we have tâ€¦]]
[[skills:Collective intelligence, video, visibility was key success, "press advisor"]]
For us, even now until 2024, the things that we learned was that some of the work that we were doing affected or should I say contributes to the actor, the free trade area work that is currently being done by UNDP\. Because on some of the challenges that the women were talking about, it's it's, it's also challenges that, you know, traders every single day face\. So even in terms of the reports that we generated through the community immersion that we did it, it kind of gave perspective to the country office and also RBA and understanding some of the barriers of entry for someone who is informal and a woman who's trying to trade across borders\.

## [[10:22]] Yes, that's great, Charlene\. If for example, if you want to do this the same work that you did in your country, what the advice that you could give us and if you have to scale up, there is something that you could do differently or you will do the same\.

[[principles:Trust: Build trust as a must]]
[[principles:Human centering and adaptability: Less of me, more of them]]
[[tactics:Design the narrative flow and the stage to ensure the community and the desired outcome lead]]
[[tactics:Understanding the Community]]
Oh, OK\. I think for me, my advice would be build trust first before you try and ask someone to be a part of a solution that you're trying to bring for a community\. So for us, even in terms of the community immersion, we, we did it, you know, for some time and it, it, it takes some time for especially women to engage\. So a patience is also very, very important\. I think another thing I I would think we'd have done more is that maybe also involving the male cross\-border traders in some of the conversations because we started seeing that in terms of interacting with borders, women were going through gender based violence\. So some of the violence was coming from male traders\. Some of the violence would come from officials sometimes\. So we started seeing that in in in gender relations\. It's good to have women and men at the table\.

## [[12:03]] Yeah\. So thank you so much\.

Thank you\.
