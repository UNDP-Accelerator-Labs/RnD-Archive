# Data-Powered Positive Deviance: Making Public Spaces Safer for Women in Mexico Through Collaborative R&D

### [[0:02]] So hello, So we're going to start this interview\. Welcome\. Could you please start telling your name and position please?

Yes, I am Gabriella Rios, the Head of Exploration of the Accelerator lab in Mexico\.

### [[0:19]] Thank you\. Gabriella, could you tell me about an R&D activity by R and DI mean research and development that you would like to share? And also how did it come about, how did it start?

OK, Yeah\.

[[tools:Data Power Positive Deviance (for sustainable livestock farming)]]
[[skills:Reaching unreachable communities-unusual beneficiaries]]
[[skills:System analysis and complex design]]
[[principles:Ingenuity]]
So the journey that I'll share is a project that we did to implement the data powered positive deviance method\.  
It was a pilot that was conducted between the G8 set data lab and the Accelerator Labs global team\.  
So what they did is that they launched at the beginning of the of the network pretty much they launched a call to see which teams, which labs wanted to experiment with this method, which was about using different types of data sources, usual unusual data sources to identify positive deviants\.  
The positive deviants are either persons or in our case, which I'll tell a little bit more later, places that have a better outcome or behavior than their peers, even if they have the same resources\.  
So the objective is to uncover the underlying causes of that positive behavior, to learn from it and to replicate it in other areas\.  
So what we did in Mexico is that we we applied, we got in touch with GI said Mexico because it was, it had to be a project in teams, GI said and UNDP locally and together with the GI Said team, we identified a topic that we were excited about and a pressing issue in Mexico, which was safety for women in public spaces\.  
We chose that topic because at the time, and I mean it still is, but safety is a huge problem in Mexico\.  
And there we thought that there was availability of data that would be making for an interesting subject\.  
We have the panic alert buttons, buttons in the on the streets\.  
So we thought that could be a data source that we could use\.  
And yeah, we applied, we got selected and we started implementing that project to discover what are the conditions that make public spaces safer for women in Mexico City\.

### [[2:35]] Interesting\. And could you tell more about if in terms of the stakeholders you mentioned, JC, Mexico, was anyone else involved in the process for, for instance, understanding a little bit more like the context and so on?

[[tools:Collaborative design of actions]]
[[tools:Collective Intelligence for climate action]]
[[tools:Innovation Challenge]]
[[tools:From Insights to Impact:  Storytelling for Renewable Energy Solutions]]
Yeah, I would say, you know, after we got in touch with the ICET, which were our partners in Mexico, the other key stakeholder that we approached even before finding the partners that would help us understand the context in more depth was the government, because we wanted to make something that would be useful for the government\.  
So we got in touch with, at that time, it was the local, the agency of digital innovation in Mexico City, and then also with the Ministry of Women\.  
We pitched the project to them, told them that it was a very experimental initiative\.  
We weren't sure what we were going to find out, but we stressed the factor, emphasized that through the learning journey, we would produce some useful learning sort of outcomes that might help them understand how to make spaces safer for women\.  
And then the other actors that we got involved with along the way were a team of analysts that would help us with a quantitative analysis of the whole process, and then another team of qualitative analysts that would also help us understanding the problem\.  
Along the way\.  
We of course, also had interviews with many key players in Mexico in the government or in academia that would help us get a better understanding of the underlying issues between behind the situation in Mexico in the public spaces, but also what were the the data sources that were there\.  
So in that in terms of the data sources, another key actor that we worked with was what is called AC Five\.  
I don't remember now that I'm in English, but it would be, you know, the entity, the government entity that is in charge of monitoring all the camera, security cameras, 911 emergency calls and so on\.  
In Mexico City\.  
We partnered with them so that we could access data sets that were not public\.

### [[4:51]] That's impressive\. So you have like multiple stakeholders and at the same time in terms of actually that engagement with the stakeholders, did you use any specific tactics or approaches that will somehow enable you to build there by in maintain that relationship or even sometimes overcoming some resistance that that you might have encountered?

[[principles:Trust and Authenticity: Build trust as a must]]
[[principles:Partnership]]
[[principles:Trust]]
[[principles:Collaboration]]
Yeah, I would say that\.  
I mean, one key tactic, and I'm going back again with JIT because I think it's an important part of this partnership was building first building trust with them\.  
So I got really close and worked together with that Team IG set where we were both very interested in achieving an outcome together\.  
And there was no like, I don't know, jealousy or protagonism from UNDP or from GI set\.  
So we really understood ourselves as partners\.  
So building that trust was important and being very clear from the beginning and also figuring it out along the way who was doing what and for what purpose\.  
Then another thing that we did to get the buy in, I think we were very humble when we approached the government because we were going to implement the data powered positive deviance method, which was very experimental\.  
So we really stressed out the fact that we, I mean, we didn't promise anything from the start except to take them along the journey with us and that we would be sharing with them any maps, any intermediate products that we would produce, visualizations about the city and so on so that they could be also helpful with them\.  
And from there, just keeping being in constant touch, sharing along the way, the method, step by step, sharing the decisions that we made and so on helped us to be a really good relationship as well with the Ministry of Women\.

### [[6:51]] Thank you\. And in terms of your specific role within this R&D function, right, Yeah\. Can you tell more about what the skills were needed to accomplish this?

[[skills:Collective intelligence, video, visibility was key success, "press advisor"]]
[[skills:Sharing and disseminating knowledge and storytelling working in unusual thematic areas]]
[[skills:Futures and Foresight]]
[[skills:Imagination]]
Yeah\.  
So for the whole project, what we needed were data scientists\.  
So skills for that, for data analysis, then also for research, qualitative research, ethnography, that would be in terms of understanding the that issue that was going on\.  
Then also I would say other skills that were important was convening the multiple actors, convincing them, sharing a, a, a vision and the story of what they could get out of that that collaboration\.  
So I would say also a lot of storytelling and being able to connect the dots between actors that are very focused only on the quantitative data or only on the qualitative data and being able to sort of like cross pollinate the mindsets that results in the analysis to then capture them or turn them into actionable recommendations\.  
Because ultimately what we also wanted to learn was how to make those spaces safer\.  
And also, you know, in terms of that convening and also a little bit of project management\.  
One key actor that I had forgotten to mention, but that was really central to the whole project was that team of GI Sid Data Lab, which were the ones that were had developed the methodology and the ones that guided us and mentored us along the way\.  
So yeah, a very important skill I would say it would be to to network with everyone in terms of of generating trust with the different key actors, but then being able to communicate all the learnings with everyone\.

### [[8:53]] Thank you\. And you're mentioning like this communication about learnings, right? Can you tell more about what those were like main learnings that somehow you got from these around the activity and how also that has been diffused and adopted, right, in terms of those are on the outcomes, I think I'll divide the learnings at least initially in two types of learnings\.

[[tactics:Getting in there (positioning the lab in UNDP prodoc)]]
[[tools:GIS system, qualitative interviews,system mapping, behavorial approach, ethnography, surveys, util…]]
[[tactics:Design the narrative flow and the stage to ensure the community and the desired outcome lead]]
[[tactics:Creating Conditions for…]]
One are the learnings regarding the method itself and the other ones about applying the method in Mexico in terms of the of the topic of safety for women\.  
So the first part is that, you know, the whole, the global team, both from GIT Data Lab and UNDP wanted to learn how to implement this method and how it could be applied in different contexts and for different topics\.  
So what we did in our case was that the positive deviant, instead of being a person, it was a space\.  
So that's one thing that we, we learned along the way, right?  
How you could apply the method to that type of positive deviance\.  
Then also being open to discovering things along the way because we had initial assumptions or hypothesis of what we were going to find with that quantitative analysis only based on the data\.  
But then when we went to the to the field to sort of add more information or confirm what the data was telling us, we found other different things\.  
So one learning has also been really always open to what you discover along the way and never to rely only on the quantitative data because of course, that depends only on what is possible, what is there, what data sets, and you always need to to complement it with the more qualitative part\.  
And especially in terms of security, because in Mexico, when, when learning that we had is that, I mean, and we knew, knew this beforehand, of course, is that many people don't report the crimes, right\.  
So we tried to identify unusual data sources that would tell us where crimes were happening and what types of crimes women were being victims of\.  
We tried to analyze social data reports and so on, but they didn't pan out because we didn't have enough specificity for the location\.  
So in that case, learning is also that when the data is incomplete going to the field, it's what's always going to work\.

### [[11:39]] Mm Hmm, interesting\. And a final question will be in terms of the adoption of these R&D outcomes\. Could you mention a little bit more on that?

[[tools:Collaborative design of actions]]
[[principles:Transparency]]
[[principles:Inclusivity and diversity]]
[[principles:Inclusivity]]
Yeah, what we did is that we shared all the the recommendations that we found in terms of what are the tangible and intangible conditions that make public spaces safer for women\.  
So tangible\.  
I mean like how should the green areas be designed or how does the landing have to be?  
How do policemen or police women need to transport themselves to give women a perception of security and intangible, for example, a social cohesion activities that people need to be doing on the public space and so on\.  
So we had this set of recommendations, which we did first presented to that government group in charge of monitoring the security situation of women in Mexico City\.  
So that's headed by the Ministry of Women\.  
But in that same table and meeting, a representative of every entity in the government is present because everything is interconnected, right\.  
So we first shared our all our recommendations and results in that meeting\.  
And then from there, we got the buy in to conduct a workshop with the the team or on a operational level from 16 different ministries to share with them the recommendations that we found and then design with them interventions that afterwards the ministry could implement themselves to make spaces safer for women\.

### [[13:15]] OK, well, thank you very much, Gabriela for your time\.

Thank you, Carlos\.
