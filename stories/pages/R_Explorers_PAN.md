# Explorer Jennifer in Panama

[[0:03]]  
What's your name and your position?

[[Tools capture card:Personas]]
[[Tactics capture card:Getting in there (positioning the lab in UNDP prodoc)]]
[[Tools capture card:Collective Intelligence]]
[[Tools capture card:AccLab Newsletter, as tool for spreading our knowledge]]

[[0:06]]  
So my name is Jennifer Hotsko and I'm head of exploration for the UNDP Accelerator Lab in Panama\.

[[0:14]]  
Great\.

[[0:15]]  
Could you tell us about an Arab D activity you'd like to share?
How did it come about?
Where did it start?

[[0:22]]  
Yeah\.

[[Tools capture card:AccLab Newsletter, as tool for spreading our knowledge]]
[[Tools capture card:Collective Intelligence for climate action]]
[[Tools capture card:Co- created Environmental Citizen Science Solutions Mapping of national initiatives]]
[[Tools capture card:Scaling partnerships by demonstrating value incrementally]]

[[0:23]]  
So I think the the one that's I think near to our hearts in the in the Panama lab, it's sort of where everything began\.

[[Tools capture card:This inventory is about how you can use experiments to solve public and soc…]]

[[Tools capture card:In-depth interviews with repats (within Design Thinking Methodology)]]
[[Tools capture card:NESTA's Collective Intelligence Design Playbook]]

[[0:33]]  
And I think it's a special story because because of of of this story, it sort of served as a feeder for everything else that we started doing as a lab and just building blocks\.

[[Tools capture card:Collective Intelligence]]
[[Skills capture card:Curiosity, Humble, community participation, Leadership, innovation]]
[[Tools capture card:Co- created Environmental Citizen Science Solutions Mapping of national initiatives]]
[[Tactics capture card:Working with ecosystem]]

[[0:47]]  
So I would say starting in solid waste management in rural community, we, we wanted to understand, you know, what was, what was happening\.

1:01  
We saw a lot of as you do in most of Panama and in urban and rural areas\.

[[Tactics capture card:Understanding the Community]]
[[Principles capture card:Recognize local expertise: Nothing for us, without us]]
[[Skills capture card:Curiosity, Humble, community participation, Leadership, innovation]]
[[Skills capture card:Creativity, organisation, open mind]]

[[1:07]]  
But while in urban areas a lot of times, and this also depends on on what part of the city you're in, you have access to, you know, solid waste management like collection services and rural municipalities\.

[[Skills capture card:Curiosity, Humble, community participation, Leadership, innovation]]
[[Tools capture card:This inventory is about how you can use experiments to solve public and soc…]]
[[Tools capture card:Randomized Controlled Trials]]
[[Principles capture card:Frugality]]

[[1:19]]  
We noticed that despite, you know, a lot of products coming in, there really wasn't there wasn't effective or efficient solid waste management, any collection services\.

[[1:32]]  
So yeah\.

[[1:34]]  
So basically citizens are left to fend for themselves\.

[[1:37]]  
You know, there's health issues, you know, surrounding this\.

[[1:42]]  
I think there's also an issue of, I think, you know, rights, right?

[[Tactics capture card:Understanding the Community]]
[[Tools capture card:Collective Intelligence]]
[[Tools capture card:Participatory air quality monitoring]]
[[Tools capture card:Asset Based Community Development]]

[[1:47]]  
Like is, you know, when only 10% of a municipality has access to adequate management of solid waste, you know, what does that mean for 90% of the population in that community?

[[2:02]]  
So it was very much initially an exploratory exercise, You know, what's happening here?

[[2:07]]  
What are the factors that are driving it?

[[2:10]]  
How much do people care about this issue?

[[2:12]]  
Do they see it as important?

[[2:13]]  
Do they see it as relevant?

[[2:15]]  
So I would say it was ripe for an R&D project\.

[[2:19]]  
OK, sounds quite complex\.

[[2:23]]  
So who are the stakeholders involved in this?

[[Tools capture card:Collective Intelligence]]
[[Principles capture card:Data sharing]]
[[Tools capture card:This inventory is about how you can use experiments to solve public and soc…]]
[[Tactics capture card:Share your value upfront, not budget]]

[[2:29]]  
So I think what's interesting is is when you start in solid waste management, I think there's a lot of finger pointing and most people will blame the government as they're the ones responsible for collection\.

[[Principles capture card:Transparency and Honesty: Be open, transparent, honest]]
[[Principles capture card:Never deplete social capital, always increase social capital]]
[[Principles capture card:Recognize local expertise: Nothing for us, without us]]
[[Principles capture card:Disruptiveness]]

[[2:43]]  
However, when you start looking at the system, you understand that it's citizens, right, that are generating the waste and also disposing of the waste\.

[[Principles capture card:Partnership]]
[[Principles capture card:Collaboration]]
[[Principles capture card:Transparency]]
[[Skills capture card:Collective intelligence, video, visibility was key success, "press advisor"]]

[[2:55]]  
There's government actors that are responsible for collection, there's the private sector that's responsible for production\.

[[Tools capture card:Collaborative design of actions]]
[[Skills capture card:Making insights actionable]]
[[Tactics capture card:Play don't preach]]
[[Tactics capture card:Convening Actors]]

[[3:04]]  
There's also informal actors that maybe we don't talk about a lot, but that are very visible and often it times invisible waste pickers, for example, that that sort through trash\.

[[Principles capture card:Never deplete social capital, always increase social capital]]
[[Principles capture card:Transparency]]
[[Principles capture card:Collaboration]]
[[Skills capture card:Curiosity, Humble, community participation, Leadership, innovation]]

[[3:17]]  
So, so they, they can be seen as sort of like a solution, both a solution and something that exacerbates the problem, a solution because they're actually recycling or separating material, right, and taking it to recycling centers\.

[[Principles capture card:Recognize and promote agency: Enable agency, the greatest choice for the greatest number]]
[[Principles capture card:Never deplete social capital, always increase social capital]]
[[Tactics capture card:Understanding the Community]]
[[Principles capture card:Transparency and Honesty: Be open, transparent, honest]]

[[3:35]]  
But they're also contributing to, let's just say trash on the streets because many oftentimes, right, they're picking through trash and then leaving everything else behind and taking, you know, what they want\.

[[3:46]]  
So it's a complex system\.

[[Skills capture card:Futures and Foresight]]
[[Principles capture card:Immersion]]
[[Skills capture card:Imagination]]
[[Principles capture card:Curiosity]]

[[3:48]]  
I think there's, there's multiple actors and I think that's why it's such an interesting R&D exercise\.

[[3:58]]  
So how did their inputs shape the journey?

[[4:03]]  
How did our inputs how did their inputs shape the journey?

[[Skills capture card:Futures and Foresight]]
[[Skills capture card:Imagination]]
[[Principles capture card:Human centering and adaptability: Less of me, more of them]]
[[Skills capture card:Critical thinking]]

[[4:07]]  
Let me I feel like maybe the context a little bit their inputs, OK, their inputs such as like I'm thinking that's fine to think, yeah, edit I was skipping some because she was OK\.

[[4:24]]  
Yeah\.

[[Principles capture card:Even when the Lab is not there (or UNDP) things should continue - we have t…]]
[[Principles capture card:Always be proactive, never be afraid of failure]]
[[Tools capture card:Horizon Scanning]]
[[Principles capture card:Ingenuity]]

[[4:25]]  
So I think I think as as labs, one of the special things that we we start with when analyzing, you know, R&D, it's sort of the sense right sensing and exploring\.

[[Tools capture card:Design Thinking (for public innovation)]]
[[Tools capture card:Systemic Design]]
[[Principles capture card:Recognize local expertise: Nothing for us, without us]]
[[Principles capture card:Co-creation]]

[[4:43]]  
And I think the inputs are very much a part of not only the design, but first it's like understanding the problem, right\.

[[Principles capture card:Recognize local expertise: Nothing for us, without us]]
[[Principles capture card:Never deplete social capital, always increase social capital]]
[[Tools capture card:Collective Intelligence]]
[[Principles capture card:Recognize and promote agency: Enable agency, the greatest choice for the greatest number]]

[[4:51]]  
So inputs from the municipality, let's just start with the government actor, they have scarce resources that are allocated towards waste collection, right?

[[Tools capture card:Crowd-mapping]]
[[Tools capture card:Urbanist AI]]
[[Tools capture card:Participatory air quality monitoring]]
[[Tools capture card:Jane Walks]]

[[5:05]]  
So for example, they have one vehicle to to basically to do rounds in, let's just say an area the size of New York City, right?

[[5:18]]  
That's kind of impossible for the municipality\.

[[5:21]]  
So then that's one perspective\.

[[Principles capture card:Recognize local expertise: Nothing for us, without us]]
[[Principles capture card:Do no Harm]]
[[Tactics capture card:Asset mapping - nothing for us, without us]]
[[Principles capture card:Recognize and promote agency: Enable agency, the greatest choice for the greatest number]]

[[5:24]]  
And then you look at the citizens and citizens, their inputs are, if we don't receive adequate waste collection services, then we're going to take matters into our own hands because we don't want rodents, we don't want flies, we don't want maybe health issues that that that could potentially bring\.

[[5:44]]  
So they revert to means that might not be environmentally friendly\.

[[5:48]]  
Let's just say burning waste, right?

[[Principles capture card:Never deplete social capital, always increase social capital]]
[[Principles capture card:Recognize local expertise: Nothing for us, without us]]
[[Skills capture card:Curiosity, Humble, community participation, Leadership, innovation]]
[[Tactics capture card:Understanding the Community]]

[[5:50]]  
So in this particular municipality where we worked, the highest incidence of, of waste burning, right, which also has other, other consequences\.

[[Principles capture card:Recognize local expertise: Nothing for us, without us]]
[[Principles capture card:Trust and Authenticity: Build trust as a must]]
[[Principles capture card:Even when the Lab is not there (or UNDP) things should continue - we have t…]]
[[Tools capture card:Collective intelligence]]

[[6:00]]  
So their, their inputs were OK if we don't have waste collection services, you know, what are we supposed to do?

[[Principles capture card:Partnership]]
[[Principles capture card:Trust]]
[[Skills capture card:Management: People, project, consultants, self, and financials]]
[[Principles capture card:Risk analysis and trust from stakeholders]]

[[6:07]]  
And then the private sector, for example, or, or the recycling company, they, their inputs are basically criteria\.

[[Principles capture card:Recognize local expertise: Nothing for us, without us]]
[[Tools capture card:Participatory air quality monitoring]]
[[Principles capture card:Trust and Authenticity: Build trust as a must]]
[[Tools capture card:Participatory Future Thinking]]

[[6:17]]  
We need to make sure that certain criteria are met for us to go and travel two hours from a major city to actually pick up this waste, right?

[[Principles capture card:Recognize local expertise: Nothing for us, without us]]
[[Tools capture card:Increasing community engagement through community-growing incentives]]
[[Principles capture card:Recognize and promote agency: Enable agency, the greatest choice for the greatest number]]
[[Tools capture card:Collective Intelligence]]

[[6:26]]  
So they, their inputs are we need a minimum amount of recycled material to make it worth our while, right, To go into communities\.

[[6:35]]  
So really there's the diversity of perspectives\.

[[6:38]]  
It's what starts shaping, right?

[[Tools capture card:This inventory is about how you can use experiments to solve public and soc…]]
[[Tactics capture card:Understanding the Community]]
[[Principles capture card:Recognize local expertise: Nothing for us, without us]]
[[Tools capture card:Collective Intelligence]]

[[6:41]]  
The, the, the, the output, you know, also something as simple as where do you put a collection facility in a community?

[[6:49]]  
Well, we don't want to hear, you know, because what if it brings critters, right?

[[Principles capture card:Recognize local expertise: Nothing for us, without us]]
[[Tools capture card:Increasing community engagement through community-growing incentives]]
[[Tools capture card:Future Thinking (for human mobility)]]
[[Tactics capture card:Understanding the Community]]

[[6:53]]  
Like we don't want that near, I don't know, let's just say a food, you know, a grocery store, right?

[[Principles capture card:Recognize local expertise: Nothing for us, without us]]
[[Tools capture card:Understanding the Ecosystem when developing innovation]]
[[Principles capture card:Humain Centered Design]]
[[Principles capture card:Deep listening to map beyond the tangible:]]

[[7:01]]  
So if you have limited space, right, where, where do you put this if you don't have the infrastructure, right?

[[7:06]]  
So maybe an actor as a school, right, schools, we want, you know, youth involved\.

[[Tactics capture card:Understanding the Community]]
[[Tools capture card:Scaling partnerships by demonstrating value incrementally]]
[[Tools capture card:Increasing community engagement through community-growing incentives]]
[[Principles capture card:Data sharing]]

[[7:13]]  
Maybe they want the collection center, you know, close in proximity to where they are to make it easier for them to actually participate in recycling also\.

[[Tactics capture card:Understanding the Community]]
[[Tools capture card:Collective Intelligence]]
[[Skills capture card:Curiosity, Humble, community participation, Leadership, innovation]]
[[Principles capture card:Recognize and promote agency: Enable agency, the greatest choice for the greatest number]]

[[7:24]]  
Yeah, the communities, let's just say that are participating in a recycling, you know, project, which is what we ended up starting to to to do after a collective intelligence exercise, understanding what people wanted\.

[[7:35]]  
Communities want something that's really easy, right?

[[Principles capture card:Even when the Lab is not there (or UNDP) things should continue - we have t…]]
[[Principles capture card:Transparency]]
[[Skills capture card:Making insights actionable]]
[[Principles capture card:Transparency and Honesty: Be open, transparent, honest]]

[[7:37]]  
So you have all of these variables, something that's easy, something that's close, something that's clean, something that's accessible, something that the government can maybe handle with limited resources\.

[[7:48]]  
So there's a lot of inputs, so I'll just leave it at that\.

[[7:53]]  
OK, So what tools and method did you use and why?

[[7:59]]  
So I would think the main tool initially was collective intelligence, right?

[[8:04]]  
So the understanding that the sum is greater than and it's parts\.

[[Tools capture card:Collective intelligence]]
[[Tools capture card:NESTA's Collective Intelligence Design Playbook]]
[[Tools capture card:Collaborative design of actions]]
[[Tools capture card:Collective Intelligence]]

[[8:09]]  
And I, I, the reason that we use, you know, collective intelligence was for the, for the gathering stage was to really have a holistic perspective of not only the problem\.

[[Tactics capture card:Understanding the Community]]
[[Tools capture card:Increasing community engagement through community-growing incentives]]
[[Principles capture card:Recognize and promote agency: Enable agency, the greatest choice for the greatest number]]
[[Principles capture card:Never deplete social capital, always increase social capital]]

[[8:21]]  
And I wouldn't, I won't even say solutions yet, but where communities felt like they wanted to invest, where communities felt like what was closest to their hearts, right and, and, and their needs\.

[[8:39]]  
So I think collective intelligence helps you assess that very, very effectively\.

[[8:44]]  
So I would say that's the, the primary tool and method that we, that we started with\.

[[8:51]]  
And what tactics and approaches did you use to engage stakeholders?

[[Tactics capture card:Understanding the Community]]
[[Tools capture card:Increasing community engagement through community-growing incentives]]
[[Principles capture card:Recognize and promote agency: Enable agency, the greatest choice for the greatest number]]
[[Principles capture card:Recognize local expertise: Nothing for us, without us]]

[[8:57]]  
So I would say definitely there was, there was a lot of, there was a lot of convening and I think enroll municipalities especially, you can't just walk in and start a project\.

[[9:14]]  
You need buy in, right?

[[9:16]]  
So getting that buy in and trust from different actors is incredibly important\.

[[9:23]]  
For example, just the simple fact that you need permission from the municipal council\.

[[9:30]]  
That means learning how to speak to people's needs, right?

[[Tactics capture card:Understanding the Community]]
[[Principles capture card:Recognize local expertise: Nothing for us, without us]]
[[Skills capture card:Community Engament]]
[[Skills capture card:Creativity, organisation, open mind]]

[[9:37]]  
What are the needs of the the municipality and and how do you reach their needs, because they all represent different what we say in Spanish corahinientos or different sort of like subsets of a municipality\.

[[9:54]]  
There are 11 in this particular one\.

[[Tools capture card:Collective Intelligence to recover local knowledge]]
[[Skills capture card:Focus on inclusion and diversity systems analysis,problem identification]]
[[Skills capture card:Cultural Adaptability]]
[[Skills capture card:Creativity, organisation, open mind]]

[[9:56]]  
So how do you speak to that person like their language also and identify what their needs are to get to get buy in also identifying, you know, what are the low hanging fruits?

[[10:06]]  
So for example, we realized that it might be easier to start in one of the Corajimento\.

[[Tactics capture card:Understanding the Community]]
[[Principles capture card:Recognize local expertise: Nothing for us, without us]]
[[Principles capture card:Never deplete social capital, always increase social capital]]
[[Tools capture card:Increasing community engagement through community-growing incentives]]

[[10:14]]  
So townships that had the greater number, a greater number of businesses because they had also we learned that there were a lot of businesses that had had prior experience with recycling, for example\.

[[Principles capture card:Recognize local expertise: Nothing for us, without us]]
[[Tools capture card:Increasing community engagement through community-growing incentives]]
[[Tools capture card:How Might We (HMW)]]
[[Principles capture card:Trust and Authenticity: Build trust as a must]]

[[10:30]]  
So we knew that maybe there was a greater probability of success if we started in this particular Township versus if we tried to do too much at once\.

[[Tactics capture card:Play don't preach]]
[[Tactics capture card:Design the narrative flow and the stage to ensure the community and the desired outcome lead]]
[[Tactics capture card:Hustle your gig]]
[[Principles capture card:Disruptiveness]]

[[10:39]]  
So I think also being, I think a tactic is being realistic and grounded I think in what you're trying to achieve\.

[[10:51]]  
Yeah\.

[[10:51]]  
All right then\.

[[10:53]]  
Can you elaborate on back?

[[Principles capture card:Recognize local expertise: Nothing for us, without us]]
[[Principles capture card:Accessibility of knowledge]]
[[Principles capture card:Care about the people the same amount you care about the solutions]]
[[Principles capture card:Ingenuity]]

[[10:59]]  
Can you elaborate on principles that guided your work and tell us why they were important?

[[11:06]]  
I think this maybe ties into inputs\.

[[11:09]]  
It's having empathy really for a diverse set of experiences\.

[[11:17]]  
You know, everyone lives a particular theme very differently\.

[[Skills capture card:Curiosity, Humble, community participation, Leadership, innovation]]
[[Tactics capture card:Understanding the Community]]
[[Tools capture card:Prototyping of solar mobile kiosk for Youths and Women running small street businesses?]]
[[Tools capture card:From Insights to Impact:  Storytelling for Renewable Energy Solutions]]

[[11:22]]  
So if you talk about if you talk about recycling, right, it, it's, it might seem like something very simple, very basic, but what happens if you talk about recycling in a community where someone doesn't have a car, doesn't have access to public transportation, has never segregated waste before\.

[[Tools capture card:Human Centered Design (HCD) Workshop]]
[[Tools capture card:Collaborative design of actions]]
[[Skills capture card:Making insights actionable]]
[[Tools capture card:Innovative approach - Design Thinking - Issue Mapping - Stakeholder Mapping]]

[[11:43]]  
So how do you ask them to partake in a program that in your mind when we know, maybe if you're designing from a from a different perspective, you're not taking into account their struggles, right and the diversity of their, their landscape and their experiences\.

[[12:00]]  
So I think, I think empathy is a, a really big one\.

[[Principles capture card:Recognize local expertise: Nothing for us, without us]]
[[Principles capture card:Human centering and adaptability: Less of me, more of them]]
[[Principles capture card:Even when the Lab is not there (or UNDP) things should continue - we have t…]]
[[Principles capture card:Continuous learning]]

[[12:08]]  
Maybe I think another principal, I'm trying to think again of some that we thought about yesterday\.

[[12:18]]  
That's fine\.

[[12:22]]  
I'll think back to when you were conducting the R&D cycle\.

[[12:26]]  
Yeah, yeah, yeah\.

[[Principles capture card:Inclusivity]]
[[Skills capture card:Curiosity, Humble, community participation, Leadership, innovation]]
[[Principles capture card:Inclusivity]]
[[Skills capture card:Creativity, organisation, open mind]]

[[12:27]]  
There are some problems here like inclusivity, openness, Oh yeah, sustainability, sustainability that guided the design of how you approached your R&D work\.

[[12:44]]  
OK\.

[[12:44]]  
I think maybe, maybe Equity\.

[[12:48]]  
I think there's so many parts to the design\.

[[12:55]]  
So I think there was\.

[[Tools capture card:UNDP Foresight Playbook]]
[[Tools capture card:Design Thinking (for public innovation)]]
[[Principles capture card:Human centering and adaptability: Less of me, more of them]]
[[Tools capture card:Human-Centered design]]

[[12:58]]  
And in each part of the design, I think we had to, to make each actor felt like their role was just as important as the next role\.

[[13:11]]  
No one actor their, their role was not more important\.

[[Tactics capture card:Understanding the Community]]
[[Principles capture card:Recognize and promote agency: Enable agency, the greatest choice for the greatest number]]
[[Tools capture card:Increasing community engagement through community-growing incentives]]
[[Tactics capture card:Build an ecosystem around your intent]]

[[13:15]]  
So, for example, let me run through, let's just say we asked communities to participate by segregating waste, right?

[[13:26]]  
Then we asked a person to collect that waste from communities\.

[[Tools capture card:This inventory is about how you can use experiments to solve public and soc…]]
[[Tactics capture card:Share your value upfront, not budget]]
[[Tools capture card:Data collection]]
[[Tactics capture card:"Buy in" means agreeing to a tangible commitment]]

[[13:31]]  
Then that waste goes to a collection center and someone actually receives that waste and has to weigh it\.

[[Principles capture card:Never deplete social capital, always increase social capital]]
[[Tactics capture card:Understanding the Community]]
[[Principles capture card:Recognize local expertise: Nothing for us, without us]]
[[Principles capture card:Partnership]]

[[13:38]]  
Then at the center, you have a group from the municipality that's actually compacting that waste, and then you have the private sector that's coming in picking up that waste, right?

[[Tools capture card:User Journey Mapping - Design Thinking]]
[[Tools capture card:USER JOURNEY MAPPING]]
[[Tools capture card:User Journey Mapping]]
[[Tools capture card:User Journey]]

[[13:49]]  
So if you look at each part of that journey, none of the, the, the part that follows can be done if the previous one isn't done well\.

[[Tactics capture card:Understanding the Community]]
[[Principles capture card:Never deplete social capital, always increase social capital]]
[[Principles capture card:Transparency and Honesty: Be open, transparent, honest]]
[[Tools capture card:Increasing community engagement through community-growing incentives]]

[[13:58]]  
So if communities aren't segregating their waste, for example, and even prior to that, let's just say if we're not communicating effectively, right, how that waste has to be segregated, then communities aren't going to segregate it properly, right?

[[Principles capture card:Human centering and adaptability: Less of me, more of them]]
[[Principles capture card:Never deplete social capital, always increase social capital]]
[[Principles capture card:Transparency]]
[[Principles capture card:Disruptiveness]]

[[14:13]]  
And if they don't segregate or separate that properly, then when the person that picks it up, right, takes it to the center, they're going to have to either they have double the work, basically making sure that it's separated effectively or properly, right?

[[14:27]]  
So then they can't compact it\.

[[Principles capture card:Never deplete social capital, always increase social capital]]
[[Principles capture card:Partnership]]
[[Tools capture card:Collective intelligence]]
[[Principles capture card:Recognize local expertise: Nothing for us, without us]]

[[14:29]]  
And if it's not compacted and segregated properly, then when the private sector comes and they want to pick it up, they're going to say, well, I can't take this because it's not done properly and there's no value for me\.

[[Skills capture card:Futures and Foresight]]
[[Principles capture card:Human centering and adaptability: Less of me, more of them]]
[[Principles capture card:Collaboration]]
[[Principles capture card:Curiosity]]

[[14:40]]  
So I think that Equity and buying and helping actors understand that their part of of of the journey and and you know that that step in, in, in R&D is just as important as the next fair\.

[[14:56]]  
OK, reflecting on this journey, what was the impact to outcome of your R&D journey?

[[15:04]]  
Yeah\.

[[15:04]]  
So I, I think, I think we, there's a lot of feedback loops that happen in our journey\.

[[Tools capture card:NESTA's Collective Intelligence Design Playbook]]
[[Tools capture card:EGAP]]
[[Tools capture card:AccLab Newsletter, as tool for spreading our knowledge]]
[[Principles capture card:Human centering and adaptability: Less of me, more of them]]

[[15:14]]  
And I think they're, they're, they're, I'd say they, they are, they're always, they're always good\.

[[Principles capture card:Care about the people the same amount you care about the solutions]]
[[Principles capture card:Human centering and adaptability: Less of me, more of them]]
[[Principles capture card:Recognize and promote agency: Enable agency, the greatest choice for the greatest number]]
[[Principles capture card:Self-awareness]]

[[15:23]]  
I think sometimes it's difficult when you care so much about something because you're always trying to make it better\.

[[Tactics capture card:Expand through other voices]]
[[Tactics capture card:Design the narrative flow and the stage to ensure the community and the desired outcome lead]]

[[15:32]]  
So I think if you have these consistent feedback loops, you're like, oh, what if I had done this differently?

[[15:36]]  
Or what if I had done this differently?

[[15:37]]  
I think you're always searching for ways to make things better\.

[[15:41]]  
I think that's also part of just empathy, right?

[[Tactics capture card:Understanding the Community]]
[[Principles capture card:Recognize and promote agency: Enable agency, the greatest choice for the greatest number]]
[[Skills capture card:Creativity, organisation, open mind]]
[[Skills capture card:Curiosity, Humble, community participation, Leadership, innovation]]

[[15:44]]  
With the communities and the people that you're working with and, and wanting to, to, to, to succeed\.

[[15:49]]  
So back to, to impact\.

[[Tools capture card:Innovation Challenge]]
[[Tactics capture card:"Buy in" means agreeing to a tangible commitment]]
[[Tools capture card:Participatory Future Thinking]]
[[Principles capture card:Trust and Authenticity: Build trust as a must]]

[[15:50]]  
I think initially when we thought about what success might look like, you know, for this, for this recycling project, I think was adoption, right?

[[16:02]]  
It's like that, that users are actually adopting the practice\.

[[16:06]]  
They see the value and they want to continue, right, to create a sustainable model\.

[[Tools capture card:Increasing community engagement through community-growing incentives]]
[[Principles capture card:Never deplete social capital, always increase social capital]]
[[Principles capture card:Recognize and promote agency: Enable agency, the greatest choice for the greatest number]]

[[16:12]]  
But I think probably the greatest impact too was to see that communities felt like they were reducing, you know, the amount of waste that was going to their landfill that actually catches on fire or is set on fire, you know, multiple times during during the year\.

Also understanding, you know, how, you know, circular economy, I think the the impact how you know, a different perspective on waste\.

[[Skills capture card:Curiosity, Humble, community participation, Leadership, innovation]]
[[Tools capture card:Understanding the Ecosystem when developing innovation]]
[[Tactics capture card:Build an ecosystem around your intent]]

[[16:44]]  
Like if 50% of our waste is organic and we can and we can create certain initiatives like, you know, food recovery, let's just say, or if we can compost or just overall reduce the amount of waste that's going to the landfills\.

[[17:01]]  
I think that's an impact\.

[[Principles capture card:Self-awareness]]
[[Principles capture card:Trust and Authenticity: Build trust as a must]]
[[Principles capture card:Recognize and promote agency: Enable agency, the greatest choice for the greatest number]]
[[Principles capture card:Resilience]]

[[17:02]]  
So I think there were many different, I think criteria for success that we set for ourselves, but I think perhaps the biggest one is a sustainable model, right?

[[Tactics capture card:Understanding the Community]]
[[Tools capture card:Increasing community engagement through community-growing incentives]]
[[Principles capture card:Never deplete social capital, always increase social capital]]
[[Tools capture card:Participatory Future Thinking]]

[[17:10]]  
So that the communities felt like what they had invested in wasn't going to fall, right, So that that it would, that it would continue\.

[[Tools capture card:UNDP Foresight Playbook]]
[[Tactics capture card:Design the narrative flow and the stage to ensure the community and the desired outcome lead]]

[[17:21]]  
So I think probably one of the, the, the more exciting moments of our project is when the community actually asked us if they could modify the pilot a little bit and they could adopt the, the, the project and then with a little bit of support from, from UNDP give give some guidance\.

[[Principles capture card:Never deplete social capital, always increase social capital]]
[[Tools capture card:Innovation Challenge]]

[[17:44]]  
So I think for, for impact, I think the sustainability was probably, yeah, our biggest marker for, yeah, for success\.

[[17:53]]  
What would you do differently if you had to start again?

[[17:57]]  
Oh, wow, That's a great question\.

[[18:01]]  
Right\.

[[18:01]]  
I just talked about feedback loops\.

[[18:06]]  
What do we do differently?

[[18:07]]  
If you've already covered it, you don't need to\.

[[18:14]]  
If you feel you've already covered it, I think we can skip to the next one\.

[[18:18]]  
Yeah, Yeah\.

[[Principles capture card:Transparency and Honesty: Be open, transparent, honest]]

[[18:24]]  
I mean, if I, if I, if I had a magic wand, right, it would be, it would be nice if we could have, I think more actors on the ground that were doing training with the community like that, that monitoring and, and check up to make sure that just if there's any questions, if people were doing things the right way\.

[[Principles capture card:Human centering and adaptability: Less of me, more of them]]
[[Principles capture card:Transparency]]
[[Principles capture card:Empathy]]
[[Principles capture card:Resilience]]

[[18:52]]  
I think having that support made that consistent support all the time, like in every step of the way I feel like is like it's a form of validation\.

[[19:01]]  
Like, you know, I think communities feel supported\.

[[Tactics capture card:Understanding the Community]]
[[Principles capture card:Recognize local expertise: Nothing for us, without us]]

[[19:05]]  
And I think also, I mean, in the case of, I think working with local government, like we were, we were able to find champions within the municipality and I would have liked to have been able to support or compensate those champions a little bit more because I felt like it was a one man show\.

[[19:31]]  
And, and sometimes you're, you're restricted in, in, you know, I think in the, in the support that you can give\.

[[19:37]]  
Oh, whether other strategies or approaches that you employed to facilitate the diffusion and adoption of your R&D outcomes\.

[[19:49]]  
So other, I don't know that I've, I'm trying to think if there's anything other than what I've mentioned already\.

[[19:56]]  
So that let me see the question again\.

[[19:57]]  
Were there other skills?

[[Tactics capture card:Play don't preach]]
[[Tools capture card:Participatory Future Thinking]]
[[Tactics capture card:De-risking the intervention by promoting an incremental approach through R&amp;D]]
[[Tactics capture card:Know the culture]]

[[19:58]]  
It's more like if for your activity, like were there any tactics or strategies to ensure that the people are in the audience who wanted adopted it or will be able to use it in the future or take it further or take it further?

[[20:16]]  
Yeah, I think it's it's\.

[[20:18]]  
Keeping people informed, right, all, all the time\.

[[20:22]]  
I think sometimes we, we have to be careful not to be so extractive right?

[[Principles capture card:Recognize local expertise: Nothing for us, without us]]
[[Principles capture card:Human centering and adaptability: Less of me, more of them]]
[[Principles capture card:Even when the Lab is not there (or UNDP) things should continue - we have t…]]
[[Principles capture card:Deep listening to map beyond the tangible:]]

[[20:28]]  
In, in the work that we do, especially when we're doing R&D, it's making sure that, that people are always informed of, of, of what's going on\.

[[20:39]]  
Sometimes it's not, it's not very easy\.

[[Tactics capture card:Understanding the Community]]
[[Tools capture card:Increasing community engagement through community-growing incentives]]
[[Principles capture card:Recognize local expertise: Nothing for us, without us]]
[[Principles capture card:Recognize and promote agency: Enable agency, the greatest choice for the greatest number]]

[[20:41]]  
And especially, let's just say in this case, you're working with a, a municipality that's seven hours away, you know, you want people to feel included\.

[[20:50]]  
So I think that sometimes can be, that can be a, a, a challenge\.

[[20:56]]  
I want to see if I'm so also with diffusion and, and, and adoption\.

[[Principles capture card:Trust and Authenticity: Build trust as a must]]
[[Principles capture card:Human centering and adaptability: Less of me, more of them]]
[[Principles capture card:Collaboration over competition]]

[[21:09]]  
I think it's making sure that you, again, I think finding your champions and I think in communities, there's always, there's always champions\.

[[21:20]]  
You might have to look a little bit harder, right?

[[21:23]]  
They might be under the radar, but they're there\.

[[21:26]]  
So in our case, we had a champion within, within the government\.

[[Tactics capture card:Understanding the Community]]
[[Tools capture card:Increasing community engagement through community-growing incentives]]
[[Principles capture card:Recognize and promote agency: Enable agency, the greatest choice for the greatest number]]
[[Principles capture card:Never deplete social capital, always increase social capital]]

[[21:31]]  
We also had community leaders and, and, and this particular municipality, we had groups of women leaders that were involved in other areas, for example, in, and let's just say the Turtle Rescue Foundation, right?

[[Skills capture card:Leadership]]
[[Skills capture card:Systems leadership]]
[[Principles capture card:Inclusivity and diversity]]
[[Principles capture card:Never deplete social capital, always increase social capital]]

[[21:47]]  
There were women that were involved with youth groups in schools like, but we found particularly that women there were, there was a strong group of women leaders that were champions\.

[[Tools capture card:Scaling partnerships by demonstrating value incrementally]]
[[Principles capture card:Recognize and promote agency: Enable agency, the greatest choice for the greatest number]]
[[Tools capture card:Collaborative design of actions]]
[[Tactics capture card:Finding allies]]

[[21:57]]  
So I think identifying those champions also can really, I think, ease the process and help you scale up that that adoption because if you can, if you can get can get them to connect, I think with what you're doing, I think there's definitely a greater probability for for adoption and scaling and and overall impact\.

Thank you, Jennifer\.
