# Explorer\-Guatemala\- Carlos Estuardo Mazariegos Orellana

### [[0:02]] Can you tell me your name and your position?

Hello\. Thank you\. Yes, my name is Carlos and my position is the head of exploration from the accelerator lab in Guatemala\.

### [[0:16]] OK\. Carlos, could you tell me about an R&D activity that you would like to to share with us and tell me how did it come about, when did it start?

[[skills:Making insights actionable]]
[[principles:Even when the Lab is not there (or UNDP) things should continue - we have tâ€¦]]
[[tools:Innovative approach - Design Thinking - Issue Mapping - Stakeholder Mapping]]
[[principles:Inclusivity and diversity]]
Thank you\. That that's a great question\. So we have been from the lab working in different activities, but one key activity is just approaching or tackling specific climate challenges together with the Ministry of Environment and for which we develop like different approaches and different using emerging technologies with that emphasis and bringing together different actors\.

### [[0:58]] And what was the role of each of the actors that you brought together and how did their input shape the R&D journey that you started?

[[principles:Collaboration]]
[[principles:Inclusivity]]
[[principles:Transparency]]
[[principles:Ingenuity]]
So the the challenge was about tackling or identifying potential actionable solutions on solid waste management\. So we have in in the country like diverse challenge\. Those are like very complex and then it requires like we saw that it required like a different approach as the traditional one on how to avoid contamination for instance of this waste, solid waste on water resources and then everything that is around that complex system\. So we brought together knowing like that context, like key actors that way identified that could be useful for this case in terms of potential collaborators in on different areas\. For example, one was an expert like an NGO with with high expertise, regional expertise on open mapping and citizen science\. So we bring them together with that and then we also brought other specialists like teams within UNDP mainly like from headquarters and other global units to somehow complement our abilities and capacities in terms of geographical information systems and artificial intelligence\.

### [[2:40]] And what you mentioned already some of the tools and methods that you used, but I'm wondering if you can go a little bit more in depth in those and share with me what were the factor, the factors that you that influenced that your decision for using these tools for this particular development problem?

[[principles:Recognize local expertise: Nothing for us, without us]]
[[principles:Collaboration]]
[[tools:Innovative approach - Design Thinking - Issue Mapping - Stakeholder Mapping]]
[[principles:Transparency]]
Yeah, that's actually another interesting question because when we initially have the challenge, we start somehow having frequent conversations with with the main stakeholders\. Our counterparts, mainly technical teams from the Ministry of Environment specialized on solid waste management, on geographical information systems as well, maybe information systems overall and other projects that are more like local oriented and new like the local context\. So after continuous conversations, we found out that a gap or specific need was how can we create and utilize evidence that could drive the decision making processes of central on local governments\. So based on that, we identify OK, we went to the information systems like the Local 1 analyze what were the gaps together with the local teams from the ministry in this case\. And then identify potential technologies and new databases like data sources that could be useful to bring in right and create like like proof of concepts, right or initial pilots together with them\. That's how we identify like a diverse different technologies that could have the different type of potentials with high potential\. One was open mapping or citizen science with the that behind the idea of this is going to the field, having the abilities of going to the field and then collect new information that is unknown\. And second was how to utilize Geo located information, both available for the country that we could somehow put together and bring like relevant insights for the decision making and even going a bit further and utilizing emerging technologies like artificial intelligence on generating greater insights behind that\.

### [[5:20]] OK, OK\. And when you think back about this story at that moment in time where you implemented all these tools and methods to engage the local government, the NGOs and the different actors that you worked with\. What would you say were the tactics and the approaches that you used to engage all these stakeholders? If you could think about the steps that they followed in order, for example, to get more to build their buying or trust? Or how did you address resistance, eventual the resistance that could come up in them towards the R&D work?

[[principles:Collaboration]]
[[principles:Recognize local expertise: Nothing for us, without us]]
[[tactics:Design the narrative flow and the stage to ensure the community and the desired outcome lead]]
[[tactics:Gaining Leverage and Traction for solutions]]
Yeah\. So one tactic definitely was bringing together like the key end users, like the stakeholders from day one in the sense of having a Co creation process, right\. So having like biweekly exchanges, understanding their needs, the context and as well like the status of core and solutions, right\. That was very, very important for us because that allow us so somehow to get a really good sense on, OK, what are the current solutions, what can be done, what are the gaps, right\. And you cannot do that we believe without being working like very closely with with this stakeholder\. So that was an initial tactic\. A second one like a secondary 1 was probably exploring like outside what was going on even beyond Guatemala as a country and what could be brought back, right, that could be adapted to the local context\. So that included somehow participating in relevant international conferences, sometimes online or in person with where that allowed us to identify who are the key players, who are the key technologies that are somehow emerging that could be somehow applicable to the problematic that we have\. Right\. So that was another tactic I believe\.

### [[7:44]] OK\. And can you elaborate on the principles that guided your R&D work?

[[principles:Recognize local expertise: Nothing for us, without us]]
[[tools:Systemic Design]]
[[tools:Innovative approach - Design Thinking - Issue Mapping - Stakeholder Mapping]]
[[principles:Ingenuity]]
Yes, that's another good question\. So initially it was we were looking after like generating like like knowledge, right, and new learning\. And we actually this process that I have been describing had like different iterations and like different layers, right? When we got to a point of having like initial prototypes, we actually understood that at least to create key principles, we're first providing like low cost solutions to the stakeholders or counterparts, for instance, a central and local governments\. Because that will be key in the sense of whenever you face like units or institutions with relatively low capabilities, sometimes like processing capabilities in terms of hardware or software, sometimes even the knowledge of employing specific solutions\. So having like a low cost somehow allows them to adopt better like a new solution\. And the second one is just about that adoption, right? And scaling\. So scaling being for instance, putting into consideration what current technologies are employed by the stakeholders and what it implies or requires to somehow integrate any new solution, right\. So that's very, very important in the sense of the effectiveness of the of the final solution being adaptable and scalable\.

### [[9:40]] So besides, you know, these principles of low cost solutions and adoption and scales, what other considerations did you take into account, for instance, in terms of ethical considerations or principles of inclusivity or equity that might have guided your R&D approach?

[[principles:Inclusivity]]
[[skills:Creativity, organisation, open mind]]
[[principles:Inclusivity and diversity]]
Thank you\. So that's actually like a really important and, and also on common dimensions sometimes to think about this, what we did since day one also was to incorporate specific data sources on human development\. As you know, like UNDP produces like human development reports like country base or regional or even global, right? So bringing this type of information in terms of multidimensional poverty indexes, human development indexes like to the solutions that somehow allow us to incorporate like that we want, we will actually be somehow addressing inequalities right in any decision making process that the specific solution might be somehow guiding specific stakeholders\. So we brought together that\. And then secondly, when we advanced to a different phase, for instance, in terms of utilizing artificial intelligence like computer vision, more specifically algorithms, we took into account also the dimensions or aspects of the data sources that we're using that they won't create for their inequalities\. Or that those data sources might not be biased, right, or could have some sort of negative consequence that you might know or anticipate in advance\. So those human elements usually translated into information and data sources have been incorporated in our solutions as well\.

### [[11:58]] OK, so in what you've shared already, I can identify certain skills, you know, certain signals about skills that are needed to effectively go through this R&D journey in the case that you are sharing\. But could you maybe sum up or point out what are in your opinion, the skills that were needed to effectively identify and understand the challenges or needs in your R&D journey in specific?

[[skills:Sharing Knowledge, training, and unusual partnership]]
[[principles:Collaboration]]
[[skills:Multisectoral Partnership]]
[[skills:Creativity, organisation, open mind]]
Yeah, from my specific journey, as you know that there's always like a learning opportunity, right? But there are a few keys, skills, some of them identify at the beginning\. For instance, one will be actually to be able to convene or put together multi disciplinary teams, right? Because even though the R&D function and the accelerator law in itself, we do collaborate with internal UNDP experts like officials and their teams in with the specific domain expertise\. In our case, it was about climate and natural resources\. So that was a first step, right, How you somehow bring together this multidisciplinary themes and the same as with the stakeholders like the Minister of Environment and different themes and somehow start a Co creation process\. A second one in this case was about understanding, having a fair understanding like knowledge and expertise on data science and information systems because that will allow you to understand, OK, what are the current solutions, technical solutions that are being employed like by a ministry for instance, what can be done, what might not be that idea right to bring in\. So that's another like key element I believe\. And the third one was will be actually about the management side, right? At the end, you are dealing with different, you're collaborating with different teams, right, with different profiles at different institutions sometimes\. And at the same time you have like time constraints, resource or financial constraints\. You need to manage some type of risks\. So that becomes more in it, it comes up at the like, like management skills, right, Maybe a project or program management and to be able to to lead teams and at the same time on time under like a budget and so on\.

### [[14:56]] And now reflecting on that journey that you've mentioned for R&D, what can you tell me in terms of impact and outcomes, what were the outcomes and impact of your R&D journey?

[[skills:Making insights actionable]]
[[principles:Recognize local expertise: Nothing for us, without us]]
[[tools:Innovative approach - Design Thinking - Issue Mapping - Stakeholder Mapping]]
[[tools:GIS system, qualitative interviews,system mapping, behavorial approach, ethnography, surveys, utilâ€¦]]
Yeah, yeah, we have a a few interesting ones\. For instance, we develop about like three key projects in terms of outcomes\. For instance, one is just we design and Co design and deploy a instrument for collecting information on the field, right\. That will be under like the citizen science or open mapping tools that was actually implemented nationwide with the municipalities and we collected the information of about 30% of the municipalities nationwide\. So that's one\. The second one as a product we deliver a like a methodology mainly for prioritizing municipal level interventions in areas of interest maybe near mainly nearby like one of the largest rivers in the country that is unfortunately highly polluted\. So that's another like decision making tool\. And a third one, maybe a more exciting one than we deliver, like the first stage and is under development right now, like a second one is a computer vision or artificial intelligence algorithm that based on satellite imagery is capable of identifying automatically at the location of potential illegal dump sites in areas of interest\. So that's pretty much like training an algorithm, like a machine, yeah, that is able to perform this specific task of categorization or recognition\. And it's pretty much framed on their computer vision that is like a subset or in a specific area within artificial intelligence\.

### [[17:05]] What would you do differently if you had to start again?

[[tools:Collaborative design of actions]]
[[skills:Making insights actionable]]
[[tactics:Design the narrative flow and the stage to ensure the community and the desired outcome lead]]
[[tools:Increasing community engagement through community-growing incentives]]
OK, that's actually like a good question as well\. Probably many things\. I think we might still do it the same, OK\. But a few things that we might do differently will be about timing, right? What we learn is that sometimes we, you can create momentums that that might change maybe with the specific administrations, right? Like who is in charge\. As you know, there are also like different core ends or priorities that might change over time with your stakeholders\. So that's important to to understand\. So that's something that we might need to approach like a better in the sense of what, when is the right timing right to maybe deliver something and when is the right timing also even how you engage or adapt with certain agility and ability based on those different contexts, right\. So that can imply from the economic context of the country, maybe the same environmental context, but sometimes there might be some more like pressure even events in terms of environment and not natural resources, the political one as well\. So how you put those dimension in place, understand a little bit more about uncertainty and how you act based on that\. At the end, it's about delivering valuable propositions that can be useful to our stakeholders, but more importantly that could have a positive impact on human beings like citizens in our home country\.

### [[19:02]] And is there any last comment you would like to share with us regarding the diffusion and adoption of your R&D outcomes like certain things that you did?

[[principles:Even when the Lab is not there (or UNDP) things should continue - we have tâ€¦]]
[[tools:Personas]]
[[tactics:Designing the pipelines]]
[[principles:Collaboration]]
Yes, I, I would like to address 1 one last comment\. And it's just the value behind the Accelerator Labs global network\. So we have also learned a lot in terms of some other labs have been working on similar challenges\. So we learn from that and other labs actually have been also tackling maybe other challenges, but with different like with similar tools\. OK\. One example is in Colombia for instance that our common partner, the initial one that we start working on open mapping and open citizen science, we started working with the lab from Colombia based on our initial collaboration\. So that's\. Something we believe that is very valuable in how we somehow transfer that that knowledge even beyond our home country\. And related to that is also that the Labs network is increasingly being recognized for its type of work in also innovation ecosystems, for instance, like the UN World Data Forum that this year is happening in November for the first time in Latin America and Colombia\. And the work that I was describing was also accepted\. It was 10% of like the total proposals that were actually accepted to be showcased and presented in these spaces together with the work of other lab in Argentina, for instance\. So this mechanisms that the Accelerator Labs global network brings to the table, I believe that's pretty unique and allows us to transfer knowledge beyond borders and then to position the network in global innovation ecosystems as well\.

### [[21:07]] Thank you, Carlos, for your time and insights\.

Thanks to you\.
