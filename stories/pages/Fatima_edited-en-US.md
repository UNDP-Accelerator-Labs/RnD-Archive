[[0:00]] Hi, my name is Fatima Ahmed Farouta and the Solutions Mapper for the UNDP Accelerator Lab in Ghana\. Today I'm going to talk about our journey with Kenta Weavers in a border town in Ghana on an ABC challenge that we did AB CS, the Africa Borderlands Challenge that we did in conjunction with Country Office Telco\. We had the brilliant idea as winners of the Africa Borderlands Challenge to set up a fund for female traders across the border so that they can easily save their money, pull their resources together, save their money and then work along with their Togolese counterparts\. To be very fair, most of these individuals have both dual Ghana and Togo citizenship, so they're very fluid identities and we thought it would be great to support them digitally with saving their money\. We went out on the field, did a lot of collective intelligence, We conducted sense making exercises, carried out interviews with both informal traders, market women, immigration officials, policy officers within government institutions and then came to the realization that we had to go back to the drawing board to rethink of another initiative as the one that there was no issue with saving money, right\. So we went back onto the ground, drove around within the communities, did what you know, like conducted\. We didn't call it a solution safari at the time, but in hindsight I think that's what it was because we just drove around to see what was the main mode of employment within the communities\. And then we zeroed in on Kente after we had spoken to a feast, key stakeholders, government officials and community leaders\. Within the community, Kente Weaving is ancestral weaving that has roots all across the coastal belts from I think Ghana all the way to parts of Nigeria\. It has different names, but it's all woven\. It's very colorful cloth\. It has now even gotten a lot of meaning\. It is worn within the diaspora community\. So it's a, it's a huge source of pride right within the communities\. I think going down on the ground, we noticed that there were a lot of weavers weaving individually and shacks in the front yards and the gardens, but the designs were not diversified\. It was the same design that one would see over and over and over\. Another observation that we found was that the quality of the kente, the woven cloth that was being woven was a little the quality wasn't as good as the ones we were seeing in the major cities in Accra and Lumi\. We got into discussions with the Kenta weavers as to whether they knew each other\.


[[3:12]] Did they come together to form groupings or did they just weave individually?

We also asked them about their challenges in in implying their craft\. A few points came up that yes they had sort of informal groupings\. They sort of knew each other\. Sometimes they work together\. They had thoughts of maybe forming cooperatives to support each other\. But there was an apparent lack of knowledge as to how to go about it\. They knew that there was there were quality issues with some of the cloth that they were weaving but it was just they had the idea but I think what they needed was an initiative as to how to upgrade their skill set and then maybe to be able to overcome the sort of luck that middle men had in the market where after they had after the weavers had put it woven their cloth, they found themselves struggling to make ends meet right\. So the teams from Ghana and Togo sat down, designed an intervention that used people from within the community who had knowledge of how markets worked, who had knowledge on how to kind of upgrade the weaving skill set, and who also had knowledge on how to form cooperatives to sort of help build this group into a stronger, more cohesive unit that could have more bargaining power\. So we sat down, we designed with them\. We didn't\. I think one of the issues that we had was that we didn't take into account that by designing this training beautiful training initiative we were actually taking the weavers away from their main source of income\. So yes, we we're going to train you\. We're going to help you upgrade your skill set, we're going to expose you to digital marketing and hopefully to bigger markets\. In the meantime, how, how was an ordinary Weaver supposed to make ends meet while they were undergoing this training? So we had to go back to the drawing board, figure out how to budget in transportation, food, you know, transportation, food as well as just a little stipend to to support them and also an initiative maybe like a starter pack after they had gone through the the training so that they could advance to the next level\.


### [[5:57]] Yeah, OK, fantastic\. So quick question, if you were a consultant maybe for a newly founded innovation lab and that you had to help them speak usefully with a community so that they can unearth things that I mean unearthly, invisible, how would you describe you know, how to have a good speech or how to speak effectively with communities?

[[principles:Trust]]

[[principles:Recognize and promote agency]]
I would first of all look for people within the community who are actually working on the with grassroots organizations who have more of a front facing job who have actually built relationships right with it with people within the community and thanks for the prompt we went on the ground and we worked with a community organizer who supported us really took us on the ground was like our introductory individual he because he had already built up a lot of trust within the community it was easier for us to be accepted when that when our local person on the ground LED us to speak to the Kenta weavers he actually he was a huge asset on the ground with us because he actually opened up doors where you know we wouldn't have even thought the things were possible\. He introduced us to stakeholders people within government people on the community level who are very influential in banding together and put putting the weavers together\. So I would say that one of the things I'd do if I was a consultant is the first of all, go on the ground, park away all my assumptions, all my thoughts about how these things are meant to work\. And just really tail someone who is well known within the community, who has the experience and probably knows a lot more than I would ever know about the situation on the ground\. And I think working with Ignatius, the individual that we worked with has been really impactful\. We're still working with him\. One of the things also that I learned was that it wasn't just enough for us to imbue them with the skill set\. Give them a start, pack and say OK, now you're on your own, you can grow your skill set, you can grow your market\. But there were other challenges\. If we wanted to create a system wide change within the weaving community, we had to think about other more tangible tools\. Not just supporting them with not just supporting the community with building their skill set, but where were they weaving? So there was an infrastructural issue at hand\. People were mostly weaving in their backyards, but come rainy season or when the sun was too hot, then there were struggles and community leaders found themselves just sat at home\. So we're nearly done with building the community a weaving shed\. It's very practical, very basic but at least it can accommodate about 20 weavers at a go and we believe that that's going a long way into actually influencing the way people now within the community now see the entire weaving ecosystem\. The last time we went down to the community we realized that other groups had also come together to form into cooperatives\. They were trying to formalize or at least semi formalize and to try to see how they could all come together to kind of speak with one voice as as weavers rather than just desperate individuals doing the, the, the, the work on their own\. I'd like to talk about one of the assumptions that at least I had going into the community based on other work that we had done within other parts of Ghana\. I thought weaving was exclusively a male dominated space and the community organizer that we worked with then said, oh by the way, you know that there's also female weavers within some of these communities\. That came as a shock\. We went around, we thought we in in certain areas we struggled to speak with some of the women, but that was more because other development agencies had left a bad taste in their mouth, not necessarily because of our approach\. So we had to tailor the way we spoke to them\. We had to appeal to also other people within the community and we had to understand that even if you want to work with maybe a subset of a community, it is more of a holistic thing\. You cannot just come into a community and say I want to talk to the women, it has to be more\. We would like to speak to all of you, but the women would be our, do you know what I mean our focus\.


### [[11:01]] OK, great\. So just a quick one before I go to my final question\. When you say we design and intervention what solution or solutions came into play and also what who were the actors like director or indirect who I mean work with you on this or who could have been profit from this\.

[[tools:Design]]
[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]

[[principles:Recognize and promote agency]]
I think I mentioned that we work with a consult a local consultant A weaving consultant who had a knowledge of the space within weaving and fabrics and all that\. So they were some of the stakeholders that we worked with\. We also worked with district officers he who were charged with sort of working on unemployment issues or supporting little rural groups to kind of semi formalize because you don't want to over emphasize formalization right because that could just act as a deterrent\. So those were some of the stakeholders that we banded with within the community\. The intervention that we designed was really providing training, providing support and making it tailor made so that it wasn't too off putting and take it and going away from just rhetoric and practical’s to more hands on training that would help them in growing their craft\.


### [[12:25]] OK, so when we want to talk about maybe the skills, because you see it's training, So what skills were already there, What skills were brought in? And maybe now that UNDP has left the community to say how is that? Are those skills going to be perpetrated or, you know, kept within the community, the community, or even shared to other communities around?

[[skills:Imagination]]
[[tools:Design]]
[[skills:Creativity]]
[[tools:Futures and Foresight]]
I think the skills that we really highlighted was just standardizing the weaving practice, where an individual would just sit there and weave whatever came to mind\. We thought about teaching them how to look into trends, how to think of color theory, how to think about maybe the use that the cloth would be put to and then so weaving with an objective in mind rather than just sitting there and weaving randomly and then taking it to the market and hoping that someone would buy it\. So those were the major skills that we gave them\. We're also working closely with some, the youth within the community who have some sort of digital marketing skills to kind of expose the weavers to a wider, wider audience\. And now that UNDP is sort of we've retreated a bit from the community, the weaving center that we've put up, the local government is still working closely with the with the community\. And the Member of Parliament is still kind of very hands on in making sure that the initiative that we've started does not, does not just, you know, fall apart\. And I think knowing that our intervention has had a huge ripple effect on the ecosystem, in the weaving ecosystem is testament to the fact that this would be sustainable even after we're out of the picture\.


### [[14:11]] All right\. Thank you\. Thank you very much\.

Thank you\.
