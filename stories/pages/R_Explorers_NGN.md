# Explorer Lantana in Nigeria

[[0:02]]  
OK, so Lantana, can you tell me your name and position?

[[0:06]]  
I'm Lantanael Hassan, Head of Exploration in UNDP, Nigeria's accelerator lab\.

[[0:12]]  
OK, so tell me about an R&D activity that you'd like to share\.

[[0:16]]  
How did it come about?

[[0:17]]  
Where did it start?

[[Principles capture card:Resilience]]
[[Tools capture card:Collective Intelligence for climate action]]
[[Tools capture card:Innovative approach - Design Thinking - Issue Mapping - Stakeholder Mapping]]
[[Principles capture card:Flexibility and adaptability]]

[[0:19]]  
I want to talk about experiment on climate resilience or learning cycle on climate resilience in Benway State\.

[[Principles capture card:Never deplete social capital, always increase social capital]]
[[Tactics capture card:Finding allies]]
[[Skills capture card:Community Engament]]
[[Tools capture card:Collective Intelligence]]

[[0:26]]  
And that came about because the peace building and stabilization team needed a unit to address the economic drivers of conflict and insecurity basically between herders and farmers in Benway State\.

[[0:41]]  
OK\.

[[0:43]]  
And what was the development issue that you were addressing?

[[Tactics capture card:Gaining Leverage and Traction for solutions]]
[[Tactics capture card:Finding allies]]
[[Principles capture card:Never deplete social capital, always increase social capital]]
[[Tactics capture card:Working with ecosystem]]

[[0:46]]  
OK, Well, we're addressing triggers of conflicts, so trying to avoid setting those triggers off and looking for interventions that would help address that in the agriculture ecosystem, because that's the main occupation in the state and main occupation of the parties that are at conflict\.

[[1:08]]  
OK\.

[[1:09]]  
And who was involved in in in that process?

[[Tactics capture card:Understanding the Community]]
[[Principles capture card:Recognize local expertise: Nothing for us, without us]]
[[Principles capture card:Partnership]]
[[Principles capture card:Diversity]]

[[1:12]]  
Well, a lot of people, the Accelerator LOVE and UNDP project teams of course, but I'd say the smallholder farmers, definitely it was their livelihoods we were talking about and the peace and stability in their communities that would have been heard as involved\.

[[1:29]]  
We ought to, we were to engage with them\.

[[1:31]]  
We had a lot of, I'd say champions helping us engage different aspects of the community\.

[[Tools capture card:Collaborative design of actions]]
[[Tools capture card:Participatory Action Research (PAR)]]
[[Principles capture card:Recognize and promote agency: Enable agency, the greatest choice for the greatest number]]
[[Skills capture card:Making insights actionable]]

[[1:38]]  
So we were working with advocacy groups that were reaching out to different, I'll say harder to reach actors\.

[[Principles capture card:Recognize local expertise: Nothing for us, without us]]
[[Tactics capture card:Understanding the Community]]
[[Skills capture card:Making insights actionable]]
[[Tools capture card:Understanding the Ecosystem when developing innovation]]

[[1:46]]  
We had to go through ministries, local state ministries that had, I'd say expertise and knowledge and insights that we didn't have on key aspects of the ecosystem\.

[[Tools capture card:Scaling partnerships by demonstrating value incrementally]]
[[Principles capture card:Recognize local expertise: Nothing for us, without us]]
[[Skills capture card:Focus on inclusion and diversity systems analysis,problem identification]]
[[Principles capture card:Diversity]]

[[1:57]]  
Of course, we worked with the Centre for Food Technology and Research, which is the State University that deals with key issues around post harvest losses in Benue State\.

[[Tools capture card:Co- created Environmental Citizen Science Solutions Mapping of national initiatives]]
[[Tools capture card:Participatory air quality monitoring]]
[[Tools capture card:GIS system, qualitative interviews,system mapping, behavorial approach, ethnography, surveys, util…]]
[[Tools capture card:ArcGIS]]

[[2:09]]  
It's part of Benue State University and the Nigerian Meteorological Agency, which is an agency that deals with weather data for farmers\.

[[2:18]]  
So a lot of help, a lot of support from a range of partners\.

[[Skills capture card:Making insights actionable]]
[[Principles capture card:Recognize local expertise: Nothing for us, without us]]
[[Tools capture card:Participatory Future Thinking]]
[[Principles capture card:Even when the Lab is not there (or UNDP) things should continue - we have t…]]

[[2:22]]  
They knew more than we did about what was going on in that space and what you could do to help address issues there\.

[[2:28]]  
So I guess I would ask what what was their role, but I'm not sure by the title\.

[[Skills capture card:Making insights actionable]]
[[Tools capture card:Collective Intelligence for climate action]]
[[Principles capture card:Curiosity]]
[[Principles capture card:Collaboration]]

[[2:33]]  
For example, like the meteorology, the meteorological association, it's a little bit maybe obvious, but but tell me maybe some of the roles that OK\.

[[Tactics capture card:Understanding the Community]]
[[Principles capture card:Recognize local expertise: Nothing for us, without us]]
[[Skills capture card:Making insights actionable]]
[[Principles capture card:Human centering and adaptability: Less of me, more of them]]

[[2:42]]  
So well, first of all, we needed guide to help us understand what was going on in all of the communities because before we came up with an intervention that we thought might work and that we might try or try to learn about in the communities, that was what's going on\.

[[Tools capture card:This inventory is about how you can use experiments to solve public and soc…]]
[[Tools capture card:Participatory Future Thinking]]
[[Tools capture card:Systemic Design]]
[[Tools capture card:Participatory Action Research (PAR)]]

[[2:59]]  
What are the possible livers, what approaches that could work that maybe are being tried in those communities\.

[[3:06]]  
So first of all, a lot of these people were, they were, I'd say they were gatekeepers\.

[[Tactics capture card:Understanding the Community]]
[[Principles capture card:Recognize local expertise: Nothing for us, without us]]
[[Tactics capture card:Working with ecosystem]]
[[Principles capture card:Self-awareness]]

[[3:10]]  
They were people who let us get under the skin of issues and see things through the eyes of the smallholds of farmers, understand their priorities around what's the problem actually was, which ones they would like to deal with and address first\.

[[Principles capture card:Recognize local expertise: Nothing for us, without us]]
[[Principles capture card:Do no Harm]]
[[Tools capture card:Understanding the Ecosystem when developing innovation]]
[[Principles capture card:Inclusivity and diversity]]

[[3:25]]  
That was a big thing because I mean, nothing else could have happened if we didn't understand that from the perspectives of the farmers\.

[[Tools capture card:Geographic Information System (GIS)]]
[[Tactics capture card:Understanding the Community]]
[[Tools capture card:USER JOURNEY MAPPING]]
[[Tools capture card:User Journey Mapping]]

[[3:31]]  
And then because they were in different locations across the state, we basically did a tour of all the souls in the state\.

[[3:38]]  
So you needed different peoples at different people at different times\.

[[Principles capture card:Recognize local expertise: Nothing for us, without us]]
[[Skills capture card:Business acumen]]
[[Skills capture card:Collective Intelligence]]
[[Tools capture card:Collective Intelligence]]

[[3:42]]  
And then of course there was a technical expertise, I mean, nobody on the team was coming with a background in agriculture\.

[[Principles capture card:Disruptiveness]]
[[Principles capture card:Never deplete social capital, always increase social capital]]
[[Principles capture card:Transparency]]
[[Skills capture card:Making insights actionable]]

[[3:48]]  
So even just getting that ground in and for them helping you understand what what the key levers for change could be\.

[[3:57]]  
People played different roles\.

[[Principles capture card:Recognize local expertise: Nothing for us, without us]]
[[Tactics capture card:Understanding the Community]]
[[Principles capture card:Collaboration]]
[[Principles capture card:Trust and Authenticity: Build trust as a must]]

[[3:58]]  
I'd say for the sense making it was essential that we had all the stakeholders involved for access to community knowledge and insights or we definitely needed them\.

[[4:09]]  
So a lot of their roles were, first of all, helping us understand the problem\.

[[Principles capture card:Recognize local expertise: Nothing for us, without us]]
[[Skills capture card:Making insights actionable]]
[[Principles capture card:Even when the Lab is not there (or UNDP) things should continue - we have t…]]
[[Principles capture card:Ingenuity]]

[[4:12]]  
And then secondly, by the time we had a handle on what possible options we had for interventions, we didn't have technical expertise in that area as well\.

[[Skills capture card:Creativity, organisation, open mind]]
[[Skills capture card:Data management]]
[[Skills capture card:Reaching unreachable communities-unusual beneficiaries]]
[[Skills capture card:Data collection]]

[[4:21]]  
So get into people who could provide data, who need the type of data that would actually be most useful, and then how to break down that data for smallholder farmers in rural communities as well\.

[[4:33]]  
So I mean, they help from start to finish in this\.

[[Principles capture card:Human centering and adaptability: Less of me, more of them]]
[[Tactics capture card:Beyond borders]]
[[Principles capture card:Transparency and Honesty: Be open, transparent, honest]]
[[Tools capture card:Nesta’s DIY Toolkit]]

[[4:37]]  
And then diffusing it, language issues, for example, that was another barrier that we had to cross\.

[[Principles capture card:Transparency]]
[[Tools capture card:Desk review analysis]]
[[Tools capture card:Data analysis, Machine learning, evidence based methods, survey (EPCV DHS)]]
[[Tools capture card:Collective intelligence for the analysis of emerging signals]]

[[4:43]]  
So not only understanding the technical data, but understanding it's simplified and still getting it through across and in its whole form\.

[[4:50]]  
That was a lot\.

[[4:51]]  
They were very helpful\.

[[4:52]]  
We couldn't so and you so did\.

[[4:54]]  
How did their input shape the journey?

[[4:56]]  
You already talked a little bit about how each of their input sort of shaped true\.

[[5:00]]  
So all their input shaped the journey in helping us understand best what to do\.

[[Tools capture card:Portfolio approach CPD]]
[[Tools capture card:Co-Creation and Validation of Improvement Interventions]]
[[Tools capture card:Scenario analysis]]
[[Tools capture card:Quasi Experimental Design Processes]]

[[5:05]]  
So that although the problem was defined by the program units in UNDP, by the time we came out with interventions, we had a portfolio of about 3\-4\.

[[5:15]]  
It definitely wasn't coming from that perspective anymore\.

[[Tools capture card:UNDP Foresight Playbook]]
[[Tools capture card:Participatory Future Thinking]]
[[Tools capture card:The Future, Backwards]]
[[Tools capture card:Scenario analysis]]

[[5:17]]  
I would say even in our final solutions, we did shift, it addressed what the UNDP team had asked us to do, but it was a bit different from how they probably would have envisioned it would come out\.

[[5:30]]  
I know it was, they said to themselves, So what tools and methods did you use?

[[5:34]]  
What tools and methods did we use?

[[5:35]]  
Collective intelligence for sure\.

[[5:37]]  
I think that is standard trade on tool in our portfolio\.

[[Tools capture card:Survey 123]]
[[Tools capture card:Co-Creation and Validation of Improvement Interventions]]
[[Tools capture card:Data analysis, Machine learning, evidence based methods, survey (EPCV DHS)]]
[[Tools capture card:Signals scanning]]

[[5:46]]  
And then also I mean basic old surveys, you just needed that because we needed to get ensure that we had quantitative data that we could use to show if we had been able to move the needle at all in any way\.

[[Principles capture card:Recognize local expertise: Nothing for us, without us]]
[[Skills capture card:Making insights actionable]]
[[Principles capture card:Accessibility of knowledge]]
[[Skills capture card:Collective intelligence, video, visibility was key success, "press advisor"]]

[[5:57]]  
So those same tools for accessing knowledge and then having it in a format that we could show, sorry, to provide evidence of what we had done, those were very important\.

[[Tools capture card:Ethnography]]
[[Principles capture card:Human centering and adaptability: Less of me, more of them]]
[[Tools capture card:Ethnography]]
[[Principles capture card:Inclusivity and diversity]]

[[6:09]]  
I would say ethnographic studies were also really important because, and many times you didn't understand the impact of what you were doing until much later\.

[[Principles capture card:Care about the people the same amount you care about the solutions]]
[[Principles capture card:Trust and Authenticity: Build trust as a must]]
[[Principles capture card:Recognize and promote agency: Enable agency, the greatest choice for the greatest number]]
[[Principles capture card:Inclusivity and diversity]]

[[6:19]]  
And the only reason why you even tried something out that ended up being really important was because people had said, OK, we usually do this and we like this\.

[[Principles capture card:Self-awareness]]
[[Principles capture card:It's not personal]]
[[Principles capture card:Give the space to others to shine]]
[[Principles capture card:Human centering and adaptability: Less of me, more of them]]

[[6:28]]  
So if you don't understand motivations and why and how important something is to somebody else, then you might just think it's a side issue\.

[[6:36]]  
It's peripheral when it's the crux of the matter\.

[[6:40]]  
Attacked\.

[[6:41]]  
OK, And what tactics and approaches did you use?

[[Tactics capture card:Getting in there (positioning the lab in UNDP prodoc)]]
[[Tactics capture card:Finding allies]]
[[Tactics capture card:Expand through other voices]]
[[Tactics capture card:Beyond borders]]

[[6:44]]  
Tactics and approaches, I would say at every point in time we try to come in as local, you come in as UNDP\.

[[6:52]]  
It is definitely an external party and you can't hide that\.

[[Tactics capture card:Understanding the Community]]
[[Tools capture card:Increasing community engagement through community-growing incentives]]
[[Principles capture card:Human centering and adaptability: Less of me, more of them]]
[[Tools capture card:Collaborative design of actions]]

[[6:56]]  
But I'd say many times we weren't speaking as much in our focus group discussions during the community engagement\.

[[Principles capture card:Transparency and Honesty: Be open, transparent, honest]]
[[Tactics capture card:Understanding the Community]]
[[Principles capture card:Trust and Authenticity: Build trust as a must]]
[[Tools capture card:AccLab Newsletter, as tool for spreading our knowledge]]

[[7:03]]  
We wanted it to be really open hearted and people being real and being brutally honest about what was going on in their communities and the issues that they faced\.

[[Tactics capture card:Understanding the Community]]
[[Tools capture card:Deep listening]]
[[Principles capture card:Deep listening to map beyond the tangible:]]
[[Principles capture card:Human centering and adaptability: Less of me, more of them]]

[[7:13]]  
So we had very intensive prep sessions, often with interlocutors, with the people speaking in the communities, with our local partners\.

[[7:22]]  
But then they would be the face during the sessions\.

[[Principles capture card:Deep listening to map beyond the tangible:]]
[[Tools capture card:AccLab Newsletter, as tool for spreading our knowledge]]
[[Principles capture card:Transparency and Honesty: Be open, transparent, honest]]
[[Tools capture card:Collaborative design of actions]]

[[7:26]]  
And I would say there was a lot more animation and there was a lot more discussion and a lot more honesty because of that, because they were talking to themselves during those sessions\.

[[7:36]]  
And then we could harvest and go through all of the data eventually\.

[[Tools capture card:Participatory Future Thinking]]
[[Principles capture card:Transparency and Honesty: Be open, transparent, honest]]
[[Principles capture card:Human centering and adaptability: Less of me, more of them]]
[[Skills capture card:Making insights actionable]]

[[7:40]]  
That was a big thing because sometimes I think unintentionally people might just filter out stuff\.

[[Tools capture card:Narrative analysis]]
[[Tools capture card:Collective Intelligence for climate action]]
[[Principles capture card:Transparency and Honesty: Be open, transparent, honest]]
[[Principles capture card:Recognize local expertise: Nothing for us, without us]]

[[7:46]]  
But what you really want to know is probably what they're not saying because it's matter of fact for them\.

[[7:50]]  
So, yeah, get out of the way\.

[[7:53]]  
Get out of the way\.

[[7:54]]  
Even though we were there in the room\.

[[Principles capture card:Recognize local expertise: Nothing for us, without us]]
[[Principles capture card:Trust and Authenticity: Build trust as a must]]
[[Principles capture card:Transparency and Honesty: Be open, transparent, honest]]
[[Principles capture card:Deep listening to map beyond the tangible: Listen deep and show you are listening]]

[[7:56]]  
And then also another big tactic was trying to ensure that everybody knew that we weren't coming in with the answers\.

[[Principles capture card:Human centering and adaptability: Less of me, more of them]]
[[Principles capture card:Deep listening to map beyond the tangible: Listen deep and show you are listening]]
[[Principles capture card:Deep listening to map beyond the tangible:]]
[[Principles capture card:Flexibility and adaptability]]

[[8:05]]  
So it was always round table, always we're on the same level or even we're learning from you\.

[[Principles capture card:Recognize local expertise: Nothing for us, without us]]
[[Principles capture card:Human centering and adaptability: Less of me, more of them]]
[[Tools capture card:Future Thinking (for human mobility)]]
[[Tools capture card:The Future, Backwards]]

[[8:10]]  
At this point in time, we don't know what to do, but we have a feeling that you're better placed and you can inform us better on what should eventually happen, which are the key\.

[[Skills capture card:Making insights actionable]]
[[Principles capture card:Recognize local expertise: Nothing for us, without us]]
[[Principles capture card:Ingenuity]]
[[Skills capture card:Collective intelligence, video, visibility was key success, "press advisor"]]

[[8:19]]  
And can you elaborate maybe on some principles that guided your work or are they important?

[[8:24]]  
I think I slid into that on the last question\.

[[Principles capture card:Deep listening to map beyond the tangible:]]
[[Principles capture card:Trust and Authenticity: Build trust as a must]]
[[Skills capture card:Curiosity, Humble, community participation, Leadership, innovation]]
[[Principles capture card:Human centering and adaptability: Less of me, more of them]]

[[8:27]]  
But yes, I would say people talked a lot about humility in the last few days, and that's important\.

[[Principles capture card:Even when the Lab is not there (or UNDP) things should continue - we have t…]]
[[Principles capture card:Recognize local expertise: Nothing for us, without us]]
[[Principles capture card:Care about the people the same amount you care about the solutions]]
[[Principles capture card:Self-awareness]]

[[8:35]]  
What's also important is realizing that even if you're in the middle of something, you're working on the solution already\.

[[Tools capture card:Future thinking]]
[[Skills capture card:Analytical thinking]]
[[Skills capture card:Making insights actionable]]
[[Skills capture card:Futures and Foresight]]

[[8:41]]  
It is very probable that somebody else might have something another way, another technique that could be pivotal and should be considered in what you're doing\.

[[Principles capture card:Deep listening to map beyond the tangible:]]
[[Principles capture card:Human centering and adaptability: Less of me, more of them]]
[[Principles capture card:Deep listening to map beyond the tangible: Listen deep and show you are listening]]
[[Principles capture card:Empathy]]

[[8:53]]  
So at every point in time, I'd say that principle of ears open all the time and being receptive to what was coming into you from the communities\.

[[Tactics capture card:Understanding the Community]]
[[Principles capture card:Recognize and promote agency: Enable agency, the greatest choice for the greatest number]]
[[Tools capture card:Headlines from the Future]]
[[Principles capture card:Transparency and Honesty: Be open, transparent, honest]]

[[9:04]]  
Another thing I think that was very important for me was not to push agendas from my office within the community\.

[[9:10]]  
So very clearly or very consciously not using words\.

[[Tactics capture card:Understanding the Community]]
[[Tools capture card:Collective Intelligence for climate action]]
[[Tools capture card:A taxonomy of emerging signals in renewable energy]]
[[Tools capture card:From Insights to Impact:  Storytelling for Renewable Energy Solutions]]

[[9:15]]  
I would not talk about climate change in those communities, although we were dealing with weather change and weather shocks that had been appearing, happening continually in those environments\.

[[9:27]]  
But we would never say those words\.

[[9:29]]  
We would never use them first\.

[[Skills capture card:Making insights actionable]]
[[Tools capture card:Storytelling]]
[[Tools capture card:Future thinking]]
[[Tools capture card:Visibility and communication]]

[[9:31]]  
And what I did get to understand was, yeah, there were many ways in which you could say that without using those two words, but making sure that we didn't use this\.

[[9:39]]  
So it wasn't like UNDP pushing an agenda within the space\.

[[Principles capture card:Agility]]
[[Tools capture card:Systemic Design]]
[[Principles capture card:Resilience]]
[[Principles capture card:Ingenuity]]

[[9:44]]  
So I think those were the three key principles that we tried to adhere to during the cycle\.

[[9:50]]  
OK What skills do you think were needed to effectively understand challenges?

[[9:58]]  
Deep listening\.

[[9:59]]  
Oh, my goodness, a lot of that\.

[[Principles capture card:Deep listening to map beyond the tangible:]]
[[Principles capture card:Deep listening to map beyond the tangible: Listen deep and show you are listening]]
[[Tools capture card:Deep listening]]
[[Principles capture card:Empathy]]

[[10:01]]  
So trying to listen to what they're saying and what's not being said, what is implied, essential and crucial, always\.

[[10:10]]  
And then always listening for the minority view as well\.

[[10:14]]  
What's the minority report on this?

[[10:15]]  
Yes, everybody in the room is saying that\.

[[Principles capture card:Deep listening to map beyond the tangible:]]
[[Principles capture card:Human centering and adaptability: Less of me, more of them]]
[[Tactics capture card:Understanding the Community]]
[[Tools capture card:Collaborative design of actions]]

[[10:17]]  
But then there are always people in the corner, like, OK, yeah, get over that and move on\.

[[Tools capture card:Headlines from the Future]]
[[Tools capture card:Participatory Future Thinking]]
[[Tools capture card:Increasing community engagement through community-growing incentives]]
[[Tools capture card:Foresight]]

[[10:21]]  
So trying to make sure that those views were included so people didn't feel, you know, shouted down on it wasn't the tyranny of the majority\.

[[10:29]]  
We wanted to try and make sure that that didn't happen in what we were working on\.

[[10:35]]  
OK\.

[[10:36]]  
And reflecting on your journey, what was the impact Impact\.

[[10:40]]  
Oh, lots of impact\.

[[Principles capture card:Never deplete social capital, always increase social capital]]
[[Principles capture card:Recognize local expertise: Nothing for us, without us]]
[[Principles capture card:Flexibility and adaptability]]
[[Skills capture card:Making insights actionable]]

[[10:41]]  
I think first of all the learnings and the key one was, you know, in agriculture, in even those kinds of ecosystem where you talk about there's poverty, there's deprivation, It doesn't always have to be a financial or a tangible kind of inputs to effect massive change\.

[[11:00]]  
Here you could see that data, so you could use new tools\.

[[11:05]]  
Data is actually notable because this is learning\.

[[Tools capture card:Increasing community engagement through community-growing incentives]]
[[Skills capture card:Sharing Knowledge, training, and unusual partnership]]
[[Principles capture card:Inclusivity]]
[[Tools capture card:Citizen Science and gamification using digital platform to crowdsource solutions]]

[[11:06]]  
These are insights on things, but data that crosses the digital divide that you can bring into those communities\.

[[Tools capture card:Citizen Science and gamification using digital platform to crowdsource solutions]]
[[Principles capture card:Deep listening to map beyond the tangible:]]
[[Principles capture card:Recognize local expertise: Nothing for us, without us]]
[[Tools capture card:Participatory air quality monitoring]]

[[11:14]]  
So things that we take for granted in other places where you have access to 24/7 information from satellite Google images, weather reports, everything on your phone, but in communities with that mobile phone with those apps and not everyday\.

[[11:30]]  
How do I bridge that?

[[Skills capture card:Making insights actionable]]
[[Tools capture card:Increasing community engagement through community-growing incentives]]
[[Principles capture card:Recognize local expertise: Nothing for us, without us]]
[[Principles capture card:Collaboration]]

[[11:31]]  
And how do I bring the impacts that that can make in their livelihoods to them in a way that they that they can integrate on a daily basis?

[[Principles capture card:Recognize local expertise: Nothing for us, without us]]
[[Principles capture card:Deep listening to map beyond the tangible: Listen deep and show you are listening]]
[[Principles capture card:Trust and Authenticity: Build trust as a must]]
[[Principles capture card:Deep listening to map beyond the tangible:]]

[[11:41]]  
Secondly, the kind of impact, I think connecting the knowledge in different pools that we saw when I got after the first mission, I, I think the first thing I said to myself was there's so much capacity, There's so many learned people about, around different topics\.

[[Skills capture card:Business acumen]]
[[Skills capture card:Curiosity, Humble, community participation, Leadership, innovation]]
[[Skills capture card:Management: People, project, consultants, self, and financials]]
[[Skills capture card:Quick and continuous learning]]

[[11:57]]  
I mean, a young person of about 2324 has already 10 years at least usually of solid farming experience on their, their, their belts there\.

[[Principles capture card:Recognize local expertise: Nothing for us, without us]]
[[Skills capture card:Business acumen]]
[[Principles capture card:Inclusivity]]
[[Principles capture card:Even when the Lab is not there (or UNDP) things should continue - we have t…]]

[[12:05]]  
So they're experts on things, on their locale, on their type of soil, on many things about the crops they grow\.

[[Principles capture card:Flexibility and adaptability]]
[[Tools capture card:Desk review analysis]]
[[Principles capture card:Adaptability]]
[[Tools capture card:Co-Creation and Validation of Improvement Interventions]]

[[12:11]]  
But it's just additional input because other factors that they can't control are changing so rapidly that they don't have\.

[[Tools capture card:Scaling partnerships by demonstrating value incrementally]]
[[Principles capture card:Recognize local expertise: Nothing for us, without us]]
[[Tools capture card:Understanding the Ecosystem when developing innovation]]
[[Principles capture card:Human centering and adaptability: Less of me, more of them]]

[[12:19]]  
Meanwhile, you have lots of, they had about what, 5\-6 universities around, so lots of specialized knowledge in their different ecosystems, but they weren't speaking to each other\.

[[Tactics capture card:Understanding the Community]]
[[Principles capture card:Recognize local expertise: Nothing for us, without us]]
[[Skills capture card:Making insights actionable]]
[[Principles capture card:Deep listening to map beyond the tangible: Listen deep and show you are listening]]

[[12:29]]  
So if we could connect those communities, if they could pull their knowledge and reinforce the impact that they have in their own separate spaces, you know, put it all together and then harvest that, then we could do stuff\.

[[12:42]]  
And we managed to do that for this learning cycle\.

[[12:45]]  
So that was the next big thing, connecting those knowledge pools that were disconnected\.

[[Tools capture card:Scaling partnerships by demonstrating value incrementally]]
[[Principles capture card:Never deplete social capital, always increase social capital]]
[[Tactics capture card:Designing the pipelines]]
[[Skills capture card:Making insights actionable]]

[[12:52]]  
And then lastly, that should actually be one of the first things we did manage to increase their output\.

[[Tools capture card:Innovation Ecosystem Map]]
[[Tactics capture card:Working with ecosystem]]
[[Tactics capture card:Share your value upfront, not budget]]
[[Tools capture card:This inventory is about how you can use experiments to solve public and soc…]]

[[12:59]]  
So a lot of farmers like got twice what they usually would get from their farms and using the same amount of seed they got just because they had more information about weather patterns\.

[[Tools capture card:Collective Intelligence for climate action]]
[[Principles capture card:Flexibility and adaptability]]
[[Tactics capture card:Share your value upfront, not budget]]
[[Tactics capture card:Working with ecosystem]]

[[13:11]]  
And then they could adjust their activities, their farming activities to suit what the weather was going to do\.

[[13:18]]  
So they had the CHEAT SHEET that they could work with\.

[[13:22]]  
And really that was what the office address asked us to address\.

[[13:25]]  
So I'd like to think at the end of the day, we kind of made everyone happy\.

[[13:29]]  
And yeah\.

[[13:31]]  
So is there anything you do differently?

Yes, one of the first things they told us when we got back was all fantastic, but you know, you told us the weather was going to stop in October and this is November and it's still raining and and then I had to look back, go look back at my notes\.

Unfortunately, yes, of course, I had my phone there, of course, and I'll no, it was actually November\.

[[13:51]]  
So the communication gap, I think basic things like we shared the knowledge in groups, we had people with the packs, but I would have made extra effort to even like get stuff, laminate them and stick them in, I don't know, the town hall\.

Give them to a number of like society heads just so that they could see it and continue to refer to it\.

[[14:18]]  
And then make sure that we were also supposed to do weekly updates as much as possible, or biweekly updates, because of course, Mother Nature exercised her right to adapt the predicted weather patterns in the middle of the year\.

[[14:33]]  
And that happens\.

[[14:34]]  
The meteorologists are aware of that\.

[[14:36]]  
But just making sure that that information loop wasn't broken because at point in time it did break down\.

[[14:43]]  
So even though they were saying, oh, we did very well, they could have done even better\.

[[14:47]]  
So yeah, making sure that the loop wasn't broken, I would try to improve that\.

And lastly, what strategies or approaches did you employ to facilitate diffusion and adoption?

[[14:58]]  
We're still doing that, actually\.

[[15:01]]  
So we've gotten one team, a project team in the office, the Northwest Climate Security Project team, and they're adopting this method of distributing crop weather calendars and training on climate smart agricultural methods\.

They're actually implementing that in communities in Northwest, two states that they're working in\.

[[15:22]]  
So that is one method\.

[[15:24]]  
We are actually also trying to get partnerships with private sector, so agro techs and the Ministry of Agriculture at federal level and at state level to see if we can get a partnership where the fintechs who can probably, sorry, the agro techs that can probably pay for the data, at least can facilitate the dissemination of this information to smallholder farmers that they users, what they call it, that they collect crops from, that they aggregate from\.

[[15:53]]  
So we're looking at sustainability now and we're still in that journey\.

[[15:57]]  
So they're fusing and catalyzing\.

[[16:00]]  
That's part of how we're doing it\.

[[Principles capture card:Transparency]]
[[Tools capture card:Citizen Science and gamification using digital platform to crowdsource solutions]]

[[16:02]]  
But hopefully we're doing it in such a way that it becomes systemic and we find people that can pay for the data, who find the data useful\.

[[16:12]]  
So we don't have to worry about sustainability so much in the future\.

[[16:16]]  
Well, it's a work in progress\.

[[16:18]]  
Thank you for the interview\.

[[16:20]]  
Your time\.

[[16:21]]  
Gosh, welcome\.

[[16:24]]  
Oh goodness\.
