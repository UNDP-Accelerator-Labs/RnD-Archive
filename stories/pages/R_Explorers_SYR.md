# Explorer Monti in Syria

[[0:00]]  
Head of Exploration from Syria's accelerator lab UNDP\.

[[0:05]]  
Well, hello Monte, Sir\.

[[0:06]]  
Hi, Monty\.

[[0:07]]  
Hi\.

[[0:08]]  
Could you tell me about an R&D activity that you would like to share today?

[[0:14]]  
Yes\.

[[Tools capture card:Headlines from the Future]]
[[Tools capture card:Collective Intelligence for climate action]]
[[Tools capture card:A taxonomy of emerging signals in renewable energy]]
[[Tools capture card:From Insights to Impact:  Storytelling for Renewable Energy Solutions]]

[[0:14]]  
So in late 2023, we, we launched this future foresight about climate action in Syria because in the last three years, a lot of changing in the nature, the weather types of crops, a lot of natural disasters such as earthquake fires\.

[[0:38]]  
So to us, it was crucial to start a foresight about about climate change in Syria\.

[[0:47]]  
Awesome\.

[[Tools capture card:Collective Intelligence for climate action]]
[[Principles capture card:Inclusivity and diversity]]
[[Tools capture card:Co- created Environmental Citizen Science Solutions Mapping of national initiatives]]
[[Tactics capture card:Design the narrative flow and the stage to ensure the community and the desired outcome lead]]

[[0:47]]  
And in terms of the, so I'm hearing climate is the issue like the issue that you were trying to, what are, are these just one or are there multiple issues that you were trying to solve in this initiative?

[[1:00]]  
Normally when, when, when we do a foresight, you don't focus on one issue\.

[[1:06]]  
It's a holistic approach\.

[[1:07]]  
So it's like a portfolio\.

[[1:10]]  
It's a lot of events, a lot of consequences, connected aspects\.

[[Tools capture card:Collective Intelligence for climate action]]
[[Tools capture card:Innovative approach - Design Thinking - Issue Mapping - Stakeholder Mapping]]
[[Tools capture card:From Insights to Impact:  Storytelling for Renewable Energy Solutions]]
[[Tools capture card:Co- created Environmental Citizen Science Solutions Mapping of national initiatives]]

[[1:15]]  
So what we, what we try to do is we started by mapping the current situation or understanding the current drivers of the climate change in Syria\.

[[1:27]]  
We used, we depended on the UNDP Foresight playbook\.

[[1:32]]  
It's a methodology developed by UNDP and we used it to implement the foresight\.

[[Tools capture card:Collective Intelligence for climate action]]
[[Tools capture card:A taxonomy of emerging signals in renewable energy]]
[[Tools capture card:Co- created Environmental Citizen Science Solutions Mapping of national initiatives]]
[[Tools capture card:From Insights to Impact:  Storytelling for Renewable Energy Solutions]]

[[1:40]]  
We started, as I mentioned, we started about understanding the the climate change drivers in Syria\.

[[Tools capture card:The Future, Backwards]]
[[Tools capture card:Future Thinking (for human mobility)]]
[[Tools capture card:Future Backwards]]
[[Tools capture card:Headlines from the Future]]

[[1:46]]  
Then we moved on to this to understand the the past, the present, and the future, what happened in the past, its effect on the present and its long effect on the future\.

[[Tools capture card:The Future, Backwards]]
[[Principles capture card:Even when the Lab is not there (or UNDP) things should continue - we have t…]]
[[Tools capture card:UNDP Foresight Playbook]]
[[Principles capture card:Recognize local expertise /Knowledge is produced from below: Nothing for us, without us]]

[[2:01]]  
Then we we learned about our current practices and the present time, which will affect us in the future\.

[[Tools capture card:Future Thinking (for human mobility)]]
[[Tools capture card:The Future, Backwards]]
[[Tools capture card:Participatory Future Thinking]]
[[Tools capture card:Future Backwards]]

[[2:09]]  
And then we tried to take a walk toward the future and see what positive things can we implement in the future to enforce a plausible future regarding climate change\.

[[2:25]]  
After that, we started developing scenarios by just asking ourself, what if?

[[2:33]]  
So, you know, Syria as a country has faced in the last 14 years a lot of crisis\.

[[Tools capture card:Headlines from the Future]]
[[Tools capture card:Innovation Challenge]]
[[Principles capture card:Never deplete social capital, always increase social capital]]
[[Tools capture card:Scenario analysis]]

[[2:44]]  
The the, the longest crisis, the earthquake, the fires and and there's a huge economical crisis right now\.

[[2:53]]  
So one of the scenarios is what if Syria witnessed a long period of peace?

[[Tools capture card:Innovation Challenge]]
[[Tools capture card:Scaling partnerships by demonstrating value incrementally]]
[[Tools capture card:8 Elements (or Steps) for Policy Innovation]]
[[Tools capture card:Headlines from the Future]]

[[3:02]]  
This will bring new investments to the country we and so the there will be more stability\.

[[3:11]]  
So all the the power would be diverted to focus on climate change\.

[[3:17]]  
Then after such scenario, we always we also had like six to seven multiple scenarios\.

[[Tools capture card:Scenario analysis]]
[[Tools capture card:Future Thinking (for human mobility)]]
[[Tools capture card:Headlines from the Future]]
[[Tools capture card:Future's Triangle]]

[[3:25]]  
And then we map the probability and the likelihood of each scenario because As for the scenario, which as just mentioned, it's most probably or unlikely to happen because the region has never faced a long period of peace thousand years ago until the current days\.

[[3:45]]  
So unlikely this will going to happen\.

[[Tools capture card:Future Thinking (for human mobility)]]
[[Tools capture card:Scenario analysis]]
[[Tools capture card:The Future, Backwards]]
[[Tools capture card:Future Backwards]]

[[3:48]]  
So as as a foresight for the future, we have to look for alternative, alternative scenarios\.

[[3:56]]  
And that was the case, we finished the scenarios, then we OK, we launched the foresight\.

[[Principles capture card:Partnership]]
[[Principles capture card:Collaboration]]
[[Tools capture card:Scaling partnerships by demonstrating value incrementally]]
[[Skills capture card:Making insights actionable]]

[[4:02]]  
And so in terms of this initiative that you were, you're talking about like who were your partners or sort of your stakeholders?

[[Principles capture card:Collaboration]]
[[Skills capture card:Futures and Foresight]]
[[Skills capture card:Collective intelligence, video, visibility was key success, "press advisor"]]
[[Principles capture card:Empathy]]

[[4:10]]  
How were they involved and how do you think they have contributed to this R&D journey of yours?

[[Tools capture card:Future Thinking (for human mobility)]]
[[Tools capture card:The Future, Backwards]]
[[Tools capture card:Participatory Future Thinking]]
[[Tools capture card:Headlines from the Future]]

[[4:16]]  
You know, OK, you know, you can't think about the future in isolation because not only us own the future, it's it's, it's joint, it's the future is for everyone\.

[[Tools capture card:Systemic Design]]
[[Tools capture card:Design Thinking (for public innovation)]]
[[Tools capture card:Scaling partnerships by demonstrating value incrementally]]
[[Tools capture card:Human Centered Design (HCD) Workshop]]

[[4:32]]  
So as much as partners we can get on board to design or foresee a future, the better the solid it is\.

[[Tools capture card:UNDP Foresight Playbook]]
[[Tools capture card:Collaborative design of actions]]
[[Tools capture card:Foresight]]
[[Tools capture card:Scaling partnerships by demonstrating value incrementally]]

[[4:44]]  
So in our case, in this climate, we were as accelerator lab, UNDP country office, there was subject matters from Syria experts, we made workshops with the local communities, we did our research online and we sent peer reviews to some colleagues and peers and technical experts from outside Syria just to make sense that this is a very comprehensive foresight\.

[[Tactics capture card:Design the narrative flow and the stage to ensure the community and the desired outcome lead]]
[[Tools capture card:Innovative approach - Design Thinking - Issue Mapping - Stakeholder Mapping]]
[[Tools capture card:Collaborative design of actions]]
[[Skills capture card:Making insights actionable]]

[[5:11]]  
We also let's say we also have this discussions and workshops with policy influencers who can, who can help us to really let's say take serious steps towards this, this future\.

[[5:32]]  
Thanks for sharing that\.

[[Principles capture card:Diversity]]
[[Principles capture card:Collaboration]]
[[Principles capture card:Recognize local expertise /Knowledge is produced from below: Nothing for us, without us]]
[[Principles capture card:Human centering and adaptability: Less of me, more of them]]

[[5:33]]  
So you think what I'm hearing is that somehow these stakeholders have provided sort of diversity of knowledge and inputs to your R&D journey, is that correct?

[[5:47]]  
Yes\.

[[Principles capture card:Recognize local expertise /Knowledge is produced from below: Nothing for us, without us]]
[[Principles capture card:Inclusivity and diversity]]
[[Principles capture card:Accessibility of knowledge]]
[[Skills capture card:Collective intelligence, video, visibility was key success, "press advisor"]]

[[5:49]]  
In terms of what was the question, no, I just wanted to, I just wanted to clarify the what I'm hearing is that, you know, you were working with knowledge experts and program experts\.

[[Principles capture card:Diversity]]
[[Principles capture card:Deep listening to map beyond the tangible:]]
[[Principles capture card:Human centering and adaptability: Less of me, more of them]]
[[Skills capture card:Collective Intelligence]]

[[6:05]]  
So it feels like their input to your R&D journey was more of like diversity of knowledge, like in terms of robustness, richness of of what your the topics that you were talking about\.

[[6:21]]  
Yeah, of course\.

[[Tools capture card:Foresight]]
[[Tools capture card:UNDP Foresight Playbook]]
[[Skills capture card:Futures and Foresight]]
[[Principles capture card:Recognize local expertise /Knowledge is produced from below: Nothing for us, without us]]

[[6:24]]  
But not just that foresight also is only is, is not only foresight also is about imagination\.

[[Tools capture card:Future Thinking (for human mobility)]]
[[Tools capture card:Participatory Future Thinking]]
[[Tools capture card:The Future, Backwards]]
[[Tools capture card:Headlines from the Future]]

[[6:33]]  
So it was crucial for us to get people on board who can really imagine how future could be here\.

[[Tools capture card:Design Thinking (for public innovation)]]
[[Tools capture card:Future Thinking (for human mobility)]]
[[Tools capture card:User Journey Mapping - Design Thinking]]
[[Tools capture card:Systemic Design]]

[[6:41]]  
We're not talking about a tool that will help us to plan directly or to have accurate planning\.

[[6:47]]  
We're not planning for the future\.

[[6:49]]  
We are imagining the future\.

[[6:50]]  
And that's that's the difference between having a foresight and having a focused\.

[[6:56]]  
So beside beside knowledge, there have to be imaginations\.

[[7:04]]  
Got you\.

[[7:05]]  
So I've been hearing foresight\.

[[7:08]]  
I believe it's a tool, right?

[[7:10]]  
Like that you've been mentioning\.

[[7:12]]  
So let's dig deep a bit about the tools and methods\.

[[7:15]]  
So what were the tools and methods that you used?

[[7:19]]  
I guess what is foresight?

[[7:21]]  
What are there any others?

[[7:22]]  
Or you can explore deeper Foresight\.

[[7:26]]  
The main method, it's the foresight\.

[[7:29]]  
The foresight is a method to foresee the future, to imagine the future\.

[[7:33]]  
The tools we have used, we have used more than five or six tools in this\.

[[Tools capture card:Collective Intelligence for climate action]]
[[Principles capture card:Agility]]
[[Tools capture card:Innovation Ecosystem Map]]
[[Tools capture card:Understanding the Ecosystem when developing innovation]]

[[7:38]]  
So in mapping the current situation or the current drivers, we use Pestle analysis to understand the consequences of the climate change\.

[[7:47]]  
We use the future wheel, we use the future triangle\.

[[Tools capture card:Scenario analysis]]
[[Tools capture card:Heuristic and Scenario-Based Evaluation]]
[[Tools capture card:UNDP Foresight Playbook]]
[[Tools capture card:Future Thinking (for human mobility)]]

[[7:50]]  
And we use scenario development to to understand or to, let's say, to design these multiple scenarios\.

[[Tools capture card:Future Thinking (for human mobility)]]
[[Tools capture card:Future's Triangle]]
[[Tools capture card:Scenario analysis]]
[[Tools capture card:Exploring Futures: A guide to driving change, foreseeing trends]]

[[8:01]]  
And then we use the probability and the likelihood matrix to just to be able to identify what, what scenarios are likely to happen and what's not\.

[[Tools capture card:Design Thinking (for public innovation)]]
[[Tools capture card:UNDP Foresight Playbook]]
[[Tools capture card:Systemic Design]]
[[Skills capture card:Making insights actionable]]

[[8:15]]  
And yeah, the last thing we use design thinking to come up with like 3 projects or 20 recommendations just to make sure\.

[[8:33]]  
All right\.

[[8:34]]  
So it seems like you have quite a number of tools including design thinking\.

[[Skills capture card:Making insights actionable]]
[[Tools capture card:Collaborative design of actions]]
[[Principles capture card:Collaboration]]
[[Tactics capture card:Design the narrative flow and the stage to ensure the community and the desired outcome lead]]

[[8:39]]  
So maybe we could delve deeper in the tactics and approaches that you use to engage your stakeholders\.

[[8:46]]  
As you said, you know it's a future for all\.

[[8:50]]  
You have a multiple stakeholders\.

[[Tactics capture card:Convening Actors]]
[[Tactics capture card:Convening actors]]
[[Tactics capture card:Negotiation/Communication]]
[[Tactics capture card:Expand through other voices]]

[[8:52]]  
What were they sort of the tactics and approaches that you did to convene them, to engage them?

[[Skills capture card:Communication, partnership, public relations]]
[[Skills capture card:Time Management and adaptability]]
[[Skills capture card:Facilitation skills]]
[[Skills capture card:Adaptability]]

[[8:59]]  
And if there was any challenges to your R&D work, how did you, how did you, how were you able to kind of bring them all together?

[[Tools capture card:UNDP Foresight Playbook]]
[[Tactics capture card:Getting in there (positioning the lab in UNDP prodoc)]]
[[Tools capture card:Foresight]]
[[Tools capture card:Scenario analysis]]

[[9:07]]  
Yes, since it was the first foresight experience in Syria in general, not just with the UNDP, our most tactics is just to make this fuzz about about the topic and to make it fancy so and take care of all the details\.

[[9:28]]  
So one of the tactics that was that is just to create a branding for this foresight\.

[[9:35]]  
So from posters to badges to, you know, everything about it was different\.

[[Tactics capture card:Play don't preach]]
[[Tactics capture card:De-risking the intervention by promoting an incremental approach through R&amp;D]]
[[Tactics capture card:Community event to sensitize people]]
[[Tactics capture card:Human centered design to engage people]]

[[9:41]]  
So this is the first tactic just to, to engage more people and to, to make it sound, let's say, appealing to people\.

[[Tools capture card:Foresight]]
[[Tools capture card:Headlines from the Future]]
[[Tools capture card:UNDP Foresight Playbook]]
[[Principles capture card:Deep listening to map beyond the tangible: Listen deep and show you are listening]]

[[9:49]]  
The second thing that we did is we did a try run before, before the actual, the actual foresight sessions because it's a it's a new topic and we wanted to learn more about this topic just to be able to drive the discussion and not to have this bottlenecks or have to, especially in Syria due to the recent events and the, the, the emerging needs of the population thinking about the future is being locked\.

[[10:23]]  
It's not that common, it's not that easy\.

[[Principles capture card:Deep listening to map beyond the tangible:]]
[[Principles capture card:Deep listening to map beyond the tangible: Listen deep and show you are listening]]
[[Tactics capture card:Design the narrative flow and the stage to ensure the community and the desired outcome lead]]
[[Principles capture card:Give the space to others to shine]]

[[10:26]]  
So to us, it was crucial to to do a dry run just just to make sense, to be able to drive the conversation, to stimulate people to talk\.

[[10:35]]  
This is the second tactic\.

[[10:37]]  
The third tactic is always do after the sessions\.

[[10:43]]  
Always make give updates, keep people posted, keep them in the loop\.

[[10:50]]  
This is the three most tactics that we used in this and always ask people for more\.

[[Tools capture card:Design Thinking (for public innovation)]]
[[Principles capture card:Human centering and adaptability: Less of me, more of them]]
[[Tools capture card:Future Thinking (for human mobility)]]
[[Tools capture card:Participatory Future Thinking]]

[[10:57]]  
Never, especially when when we're designing the future, ask as much people as you can and don't just ask the people who who think just like you, they will give you the answers that you want, but try to ask people with different mindset\.

[[11:13]]  
This is very important\.

[[11:15]]  
Thanks for sharing\.

[[11:16]]  
That is so true\.

[[11:17]]  
Diversity of things are very, you know, creates richness\.

[[11:23]]  
OK, so can we elaborate maybe on the principles that guided your RNC work?

[[Tools capture card:Design Thinking (for public innovation)]]
[[Skills capture card:Making insights actionable]]
[[Tools capture card:Systemic Design]]
[[Tools capture card:Human Centered Design (HCD) Workshop]]

[[11:28]]  
So sort of abiding principles may be when you were designing the work, like what was like really like this is really important\.

[[11:37]]  
We need to make sure that the design fits this principles\.

[[Tools capture card:Future Thinking (for human mobility)]]
[[Tools capture card:Participatory Future Thinking]]
[[Skills capture card:Futures and Foresight]]
[[Tools capture card:Methodology guide: Futures thinking workshop]]

[[11:40]]  
Yes, when the main principle that was showing all the time is try to keep your emotions away from the futures you're designing or you're imagining\.

[[11:56]]  
This is the first one\.

[[11:57]]  
Keep it as neutral as you can\.

[[Tools capture card:Future Thinking (for human mobility)]]
[[Tools capture card:Headlines from the Future]]
[[Tools capture card:Scenario analysis]]
[[Tools capture card:Participatory Future Thinking]]

[[12:00]]  
Just don't put your opinions and overviews in the future that you're imagining because this is not the case\.

[[12:09]]  
The future, we're just imagining the future\.

[[12:11]]  
We're not we're not controlling the future\.

[[12:14]]  
This is this principle is very important\.

[[12:17]]  
So that was the main, the main character, the main principle\.

[[12:21]]  
The the second principle is don't be afraid of going further\.

[[Principles capture card:Human centering and adaptability: Less of me, more of them]]
[[Principles capture card:Recognize local expertise /Knowledge is produced from below: Nothing for us, without us]]
[[Tools capture card:The Future, Backwards]]
[[Principles capture card:Deep listening to map beyond the tangible:]]

[[12:29]]  
Always go beyond what's logical to us because no, 130 years ago, no one ever imagined that people would be able to communicate with their relatives and friends and loved ones from like 5000 kilometers distance through a sheer of class\.

[[12:56]]  
And now it's very common\.

[[Tools capture card:Future Thinking (for human mobility)]]
[[Principles capture card:Deep listening to map beyond the tangible:]]
[[Tools capture card:Participatory Future Thinking]]
[[Principles capture card:Human centering and adaptability: Less of me, more of them]]

[[12:58]]  
So never be afraid to experience or to explore beyond the future what's going there and beyond what?

[[13:06]]  
What seems logical\.

[[13:07]]  
Yeah\.

[[13:08]]  
Dream day\.

[[13:08]]  
Impossible because it can be possible\.

[[13:12]]  
Anything else with that?

[[13:14]]  
No\.

[[13:15]]  
OK, these are really good principles\.

[[13:18]]  
So then let's go to skills\.

[[Skills capture card:Writing proposals/blogs/TORs/grants]]
[[Skills capture card:Pitching skill]]
[[Skills capture card:Digital Skills]]
[[Skills capture card:Convening skills]]

[[13:20]]  
So what were the skills that were needed to effectively do your RND work, address the challenges of your RND work?

[[13:30]]  
What were these types of skills?

[[13:33]]  
You can either, you know, any\.

[[13:37]]  
Yeah\.

[[13:39]]  
The most important skills was listening, deep listening\.

[[Principles capture card:Deep listening to map beyond the tangible:]]
[[Tools capture card:Deep listening]]
[[Principles capture card:Human centering and adaptability: Less of me, more of them]]
[[Principles capture card:Deep listening to map beyond the tangible: Listen deep and show you are listening]]

[[13:43]]  
You have to really know how to listen to people's and to understand their backgrounds, their opinions\.

[[13:49]]  
The second was is the curation, let's say, or the codification\.

[[Skills capture card:Making insights actionable]]
[[Principles capture card:Human centering and adaptability: Less of me, more of them]]
[[Tools capture card:The Future, Backwards]]
[[Principles capture card:Disruptiveness]]

[[13:55]]  
How can you transform what they are saying into something understandable from the majority or to anyone?

[[14:05]]  
The third skill is, I don't know if it's a skill or if it's a mindset\.

[[14:11]]  
Just keep an open minded\.

[[14:15]]  
Yeah, that was this is very important\.

[[Principles capture card:Empathy]]
[[Principles capture card:Care about the people the same amount you care about the solutions]]
[[Principles capture card:Disruptiveness]]
[[Principles capture card:Resilience]]

[[14:18]]  
And the 4th one is patience, patience, patience because you have to really repeat things to go through with things to sometimes over analyze or over, let's say over demonstrate things just to make sure the, the contributors or who shares the, the imagination with you or really understand what we're talking about\.

[[14:44]]  
Thanks for sharing\.

[[Skills capture card:Literature review and desk research]]
[[Skills capture card:Digital Skills]]
[[Skills capture card:Writing proposals/blogs/TORs/grants]]
[[Skills capture card:Comm]]

[[14:45]]  
These are it's like kind of more soft skills sometimes you say, but you could say that these are very important foundational skills and consistent regular skills that you need to always put into that work\.

[[14:58]]  
Let's reflect on the journey\.

[[14:59]]  
So how has it been in terms of like the impact or the outcome of your R&D work?

[[Tactics capture card:Play don't preach]]
[[Tactics capture card:Human centered design to engage people]]
[[Skills capture card:Creativity, organisation, open mind]]
[[Principles capture card:Human centering and adaptability: Less of me, more of them]]

[[15:06]]  
Yes, these types of folk, in my opinion, the main key is how do you diffuse and how do you catalyze people to, to come on board and to really, let's say, adopt the, the scenarios or the futures you're, you're imagining\.

[[Tools capture card:USER JOURNEY MAPPING]]
[[Tools capture card:User Journey Mapping]]
[[Tools capture card:User Journey Mapping - Design Thinking]]
[[Tools capture card:User Journey]]

[[15:26]]  
So what we've tried to do, the journey was at the beginning, it was easier than moving forward\.

[[Tools capture card:UNDP Foresight Playbook]]
[[Tools capture card:Foresight]]
[[Tools capture card:Headlines from the Future]]
[[Principles capture card:Even when the Lab is not there (or UNDP) things should continue - we have t…]]

[[15:34]]  
But when, when we finished the foresight and we wanted to launch it, it was, it was very hard at the beginning because do the subject matter, even within UNDP, it sound irrelevant\.

[[15:52]]  
So what are you doing?

[[15:53]]  
Where's the numbers, where the statistics?

[[15:56]]  
So the first thing we've done is that we demonstrated what a future foresight is\.

[[Tools capture card:UNDP Foresight Playbook]]
[[Tools capture card:Headlines from the Future]]
[[Tools capture card:Foresight]]
[[Tools capture card:The Future, Backwards]]

[[16:04]]  
And then we, we, we came to a conclusion that we should change the format of this foresight for each type of audience\.

[[Tools capture card:UNDP Foresight Playbook]]
[[Skills capture card:Futures and Foresight]]
[[Tools capture card:Foresight]]
[[Tools capture card:The Future, Backwards]]

[[16:15]]  
So the main goal of the foresight is was to influence or inform future programming as UNDP Syria\.

[[Tools capture card:Innovative approach - Design Thinking - Issue Mapping - Stakeholder Mapping]]
[[Tactics capture card:Design the narrative flow and the stage to ensure the community and the desired outcome lead]]
[[Skills capture card:Making insights actionable]]
[[Tools capture card:Collective Intelligence for climate action]]

[[16:25]]  
The second one is to influence policy makers to make changes regarding the climate change\.

[[Tactics capture card:Understanding the Community]]
[[Tools capture card:Future Thinking (for human mobility)]]
[[Tools capture card:Participatory Future Thinking]]
[[Tools capture card:The Future, Backwards]]

[[16:33]]  
The third one is to bring the foresight to a community level where people can talk about their future and imagine our future as a part of their daily life\.

[[16:45]]  
So to do so, we had to create 3 formats of the full site\.

[[16:51]]  
So the first one was a four site document\.

[[16:54]]  
It's a PDF\.

[[16:55]]  
It's very comprehensive about everything\.

[[Principles capture card:Deep listening to map beyond the tangible:]]
[[Tools capture card:Deep listening]]
[[Principles capture card:Deep listening to map beyond the tangible: Listen deep and show you are listening]]
[[Tools capture card:Visibility and communication]]

[[16:57]]  
The second one is a podcast, which we are implementing right now just to, to, to, to maximize our, our targeted audience or to reach larger audience, let's say\.

[[Tools capture card:AccLab Newsletter, as tool for spreading our knowledge]]
[[Tools capture card:Collaborative design of actions]]
[[Tactics capture card:Finding New Alternatives]]
[[Tools capture card:The Future, Backwards]]

[[17:13]]  
And the third one is an anime which now we are trying to, to also to, to implement, to reach the younger generation\.

[[Tools capture card:Participatory Future Thinking]]
[[Tools capture card:Headlines from the Future]]
[[Principles capture card:Human centering and adaptability: Less of me, more of them]]
[[Principles capture card:Humain Centered Design]]

[[17:22]]  
Because honestly speaking to us, they are the most important audience because they should have a say in the in the future because they they would be they will be responsible for creating the future for them and for us, the current generation\.

[[17:45]]  
So that was it\.

[[17:49]]  
All right, Well, you technically answered all the questions in that section\.

[[17:56]]  
So I'd like to thank you for your time\.

[[18:00]]  
I thank you for your future work\.

[[18:02]]  
My future self thanks you for all that and see you later\.

[[18:07]]  
Thank you\.

[[18:08]]  
Bye, Bye\.

[[18:08]]  
Bye\.
