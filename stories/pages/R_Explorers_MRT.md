# Explorer Nasser Mauritania

[[0:05]]  
So I just wanted to ask you in terms of your name and sort of your position and role\.

[[0:12]]  
Hello\.

[[0:13]]  
So my name is Nasaldin Mohammadu\.

[[Tactics capture card:Setting up the first block of the pyramid]]
[[Skills capture card:Leveraging technologies]]
[[Tactics capture card:Getting in there (positioning the lab in UNDP prodoc)]]
[[Principles capture card:Inclusivity]]

[[0:15]]  
I am from Mauritania Accelerator Lab and I hold the Head of Exploration position with NUNTP Mauritania\.

[[0:24]]  
Great\.

[[0:25]]  
Well, nice to meet you\.

[[Tools capture card:Kahoot]]
[[Tools capture card:Kahoot]]
[[Skills capture card:Pitching and presentation]]
[[Tools capture card:Collective intelligence]]

[[0:27]]  
So could you tell me about an RNC activity you would like to share maybe how did it come about or where did it start as well?

[[0:37]]  
Well, absolutely\.

[[Tools capture card:Collective Intelligence to recover local knowledge]]
[[Principles capture card:Inclusivity]]
[[Tools capture card:Citizen Science and gamification using digital platform to crowdsource solutions]]
[[Tactics capture card:Working with ecosystem]]

[[0:38]]  
Following a request from our program within the country offices to identify some far to reach villages dispersed across the country, we have used advanced technology methods to identify those villages\.

[[Tools capture card:Collective Intelligence for climate action]]
[[Tools capture card:Citizen Science and gamification using digital platform to crowdsource solutions]]
[[Tools capture card:Geographic Information System (GIS)]]
[[Tools capture card:Collective Intelligence]]

[[0:57]]  
So in order to do so, we combined the use of satellite imagery and machine learning models to classify and identify with a certain precision those villages\.

[[Tactics capture card:De-risking the intervention by promoting an incremental approach through R&amp;D]]
[[Principles capture card:Transparency]]
[[Principles capture card:Inclusivity]]
[[Principles capture card:Ingenuity]]

[[1:10]]  
And this platform has been developed and provided to the program so they can proceed with the implementation of their intervention\.

[[Tools capture card:Innovation Ecosystem Map]]
[[Tools capture card:Understanding the Ecosystem when developing innovation]]
[[Tools capture card:Co- created Environmental Citizen Science Solutions Mapping of national initiatives]]
[[Tools capture card:Citizen Science and gamification using digital platform to crowdsource solutions]]

[[1:19]]  
This platform has been even updated and developed to account for more options such as surface waters and also to contribute in estimating the agricultural surface across the country, which is very relevant for the ongoing survey, agricultural survey in the country\.

[[1:38]]  
And thanks for sharing\.

[[1:42]]  
So I hear agriculture was that the development issue that you were trying to address?

[[Tools capture card:GIS system, qualitative interviews,system mapping, behavorial approach, ethnography, surveys, utilâ€¦]]
[[Tools capture card:Collective Intelligence for climate action]]
[[Tools capture card:Understanding the Ecosystem when developing innovation]]
[[Tools capture card:Co- created Environmental Citizen Science Solutions Mapping of national initiatives]]

[[1:48]]  
Yes, this is a development that's relates to an ongoing survey or to be go to be considered surveyed by the governments which try to survey and estimate the potential of the of the agriculture within the country\.

[[Tools capture card:Citizen Science and gamification using digital platform to crowdsource solutions]]
[[Tactics capture card:Based on petition, get the message to the right person]]
[[Tools capture card:Survey 123]]
[[Tactics capture card:Gaining Leverage and Traction for solutions]]

[[2:06]]  
And be because it is a very like expensive to deploy a traditional survey such as sending element to collect information from farmers and agricultural agents\.

[[Tools capture card:Systemic Design]]
[[Tools capture card:Innovative approach - Design Thinking - Issue Mapping - Stakeholder Mapping]]
[[Principles capture card:Data sharing]]
[[Tools capture card:Personas]]

[[2:21]]  
We decided to use not traditional data as a source of inspiration to develop this platform\.

[[Tools capture card:Signals scanning]]
[[Tools capture card:Participatory monitoring, evaluation, reflection &amp; learning (PMERL)]]
[[Tools capture card:Collective intelligence for the analysis of emerging signals]]
[[Tools capture card:Horizon Scanning]]

[[2:27]]  
So we made use of satellite imagery and used machine learning model to analyze the reflectance\.

[[2:35]]  
OK and then proceed with the classifications\.

[[Tools capture card:Systems mapping]]
[[Tools capture card:Collective Intelligence to recover local knowledge]]
[[Tools capture card:Understanding the Ecosystem when developing innovation]]
[[Tools capture card:Innovation Ecosystem Map]]

[[2:38]]  
This classification will enable to identify and localize the agricultural area within the country and this is info, this information is valuable for the government as it speed up the process of surveying this area for the potential and also contribute on the ongoing project\.

[[2:56]]  
Thanks for sharing\.

[[Principles capture card:Collaboration]]
[[Tools capture card:Increasing community engagement through community-growing incentives]]
[[Principles capture card:Transparency]]
[[Skills capture card:Making insights actionable]]

[[2:57]]  
So I hear the government, are there any other sort of stakeholders or partners that were involved in this initiative?

[[Principles capture card:It's not personal]]
[[Skills capture card:Futures and Foresight]]
[[Tools capture card:Personas]]
[[Principles capture card:Collaboration]]

[[3:06]]  
Can you share a little bit more in terms of what their role may be as well as how did they actually shape your R&D journey?

[[Principles capture card:Transparency]]
[[Tools capture card:Collaborative design of actions]]
[[Skills capture card:Collective intelligence, video, visibility was key success, "press advisor"]]
[[Tools capture card:UNDP Foresight Playbook]]

[[3:15]]  
Well, this initiative was conducted under the supervision of the program within the country offices\.

[[3:21]]  
So there is no interaction, direct interaction with the government\.

[[3:25]]  
And so far it is used, used by the program to implement the ongoing initiative\.

[[Tactics capture card:Understanding the Community]]
[[Tools capture card:Asset Based Community Development]]
[[Principles capture card:Inclusivity]]
[[Tools capture card:Innovation Ecosystem Map]]

[[3:32]]  
Among this initiative, we have the PRDC, the program accelerated community, the development community, which is an ongoing program that needs to identify surface water, far to rich villages and vulnerable communities\.

[[Principles capture card:Transparency]]
[[Principles capture card:Ingenuity]]
[[Principles capture card:Co-creation]]
[[Principles capture card:Inclusivity]]

[[3:48]]  
And this is the reason why this platform has been developed to contribute in this identification process\.

[[3:55]]  
Thank you\.

[[Skills capture card:Making insights actionable]]
[[Tools capture card:Collaborative design of actions]]
[[Tactics capture card:Share your value upfront, not budget]]
[[Skills capture card:Collective intelligence, video, visibility was key success, "press advisor"]]

[[3:56]]  
So with the initiative you shared, can you share to me some of the tools or methods that you used and why?

[[4:06]]  
What factors influence you to use those?

[[Tools capture card:Citizen Science and gamification using digital platform to crowdsource solutions]]
[[Tools capture card:Collective intelligence for the analysis of emerging signals]]
[[Tools capture card:Signals scanning]]
[[Tools capture card:Collaborative design of actions]]

[[4:09]]  
Yes, mostly what like inspired us and motivate us to use the satellites, imagery and technologies such as artificial intelligence is the lack of available data\.

[[Tools capture card:Collective Intelligence for climate action]]
[[Tools capture card:Tools for developing Hypotheses]]
[[Tools capture card:Co-Creation and Validation of Improvement Interventions]]
[[Principles capture card:Transparency and Honesty: Be open, transparent, honest]]

[[4:23]]  
So in Mauritania, we suffer a substantial lack of data, reliable data we can get up on to proceed with our analysis\.

[[Tools capture card:Citizen Science and gamification using digital platform to crowdsource solutions]]
[[Tools capture card:Data analysis, Machine learning, evidence based methods, survey (EPCV DHS)]]
[[Tools capture card:Collective intelligence for the analysis of emerging signals]]
[[Tools capture card:Learning Questions Heuristics]]

[[4:31]]  
And to fill this gap, we use these sources of not additional data and we relied on methods such as machine learning methods, AIS and also the use of satellites in Azure\.

[[Tools capture card:Innovative approach - Design Thinking - Issue Mapping - Stakeholder Mapping]]
[[Tools capture card:Innovation Ecosystem Map]]
[[Principles capture card:Inclusivity]]
[[Skills capture card:Making insights actionable]]

[[4:45]]  
We combined all our development, traditional source of data and use analytics, data analysis and so on to develop a model that can predict the different goals we have set forth, including the agricultural surface water and also the vulnerable community that were targeted by the program\.

[[5:10]]  
Great, thanks for sharing those innovative tools\.

[[Tactics capture card:Gaining Leverage and Traction for solutions]]
[[Tactics capture card:Design the narrative flow and the stage to ensure the community and the desired outcome lead]]
[[Tactics capture card:Convening Actors]]
[[Tactics capture card:focusing communication strategy]]

[[5:13]]  
What about tactics and approaches like how did did you have any approach or strategy to engage your partners or your stakeholders, for example, the program team and did and was there any resistance that you have to address and how you did address them?

[[Tools capture card:Randomized Controlled Trials]]
[[Tools capture card:Co-Creation and Validation of Improvement Interventions]]
[[Principles capture card:Transparency]]
[[Principles capture card:Ingenuity]]

[[5:33]]  
Yes, it was more about convincing the program of the the pertinence of using AI and no traditional sources of data as like a foundation for their intervention\.

[[Tools capture card:Scenario analysis]]
[[Tools capture card:Co-Creation and Validation of Improvement Interventions]]
[[Tactics capture card:Getting in there (positioning the lab in UNDP prodoc)]]
[[Tools capture card:Policy experiment design]]

[[5:46]]  
So because UNDP I mean they have a traditional approach that is like on the field intervention, but using satellite imagery come comes with risks and these risks are related to the accuracy and precision, precision and identification, identification\.

[[Tools capture card:Scenario analysis]]
[[Tools capture card:UNDP Foresight Playbook]]
[[Principles capture card:Ingenuity]]
[[Tools capture card:Co-Creation and Validation of Improvement Interventions]]

[[6:03]]  
So our tactics was more about convincing the program by showing, showcasing some scenario and showing the the accuracy of the model and that it can be reliable to a certain extent\.

[[Principles capture card:Transparency]]
[[Principles capture card:Inclusivity]]
[[Principles capture card:Disruptiveness]]
[[Principles capture card:Collaboration]]

[[6:15]]  
And this is very pertinent and relevant for their intervention and it has been shared with them for exploitation\.

[[6:22]]  
Great\.

[[Tactics capture card:Create evidence]]
[[Tactics capture card:focus to creating a precedent]]
[[Tactics capture card:One foot on the door]]
[[Tactics capture card:Proof of concept]]

[[6:23]]  
So it seems like evidence based approach seems to be the tactic which is usually the case too\.

[[Tools capture card:Systemic Design]]
[[Skills capture card:Writing proposals]]
[[Tools capture card:Innovative approach - Design Thinking - Issue Mapping - Stakeholder Mapping]]
[[Tactics capture card:De-risking the intervention by promoting an incremental approach through R&amp;D]]

[[6:30]]  
So can you elaborate sort of principles that you kind of looked into that guided your RNC work?

[[Principles capture card:Deep listening to map beyond the tangible: Listen deep and show you are listening]]
[[Principles capture card:Human centering and adaptability: Less of me, more of them]]
[[Tools capture card:Collaborative design of actions]]
[[Principles capture card:Accessibility of knowledge]]

[[6:40]]  
Yes, among the principle we I can cite the openness, being imaginative and consider all the alternate possible alternatives\.

[[Principles capture card:Trust and Authenticity: Build trust as a must]]
[[Principles capture card:Recognize and promote agency: Enable agency, the greatest choice for the greatest number]]
[[Principles capture card:Recognize local expertise: Nothing for us, without us]]
[[Principles capture card:Human centering and adaptability: Less of me, more of them]]

[[6:52]]  
So we have openness and being also collaborative, trustworthy within the team and also easy going to make sure that you are building up an effective team that is meant to contribute to the expected outcome\.

[[Principles capture card:Empathy]]
[[Principles capture card:Trust and Authenticity: Build trust as a must]]
[[Principles capture card:Trust]]
[[Principles capture card:Risk analysis and trust from stakeholders]]

[[7:08]]  
Could you say there are other ethical considerations that you looked into in terms of your R&D work?

[[7:16]]  
Yes, the use of no traditional data come with risks and this risk need to be managed\.

[[Principles capture card:Trust and Authenticity: Build trust as a must]]
[[Tactics capture card:Design the narrative flow and the stage to ensure the community and the desired outcome lead]]
[[Principles capture card:Data sharing]]
[[Tactics capture card:Diffusing intelligence insight]]

[[7:21]]  
So we need to take into account the ethics that comes with manipulating and using such a data\.

[[Principles capture card:Transparency]]
[[Principles capture card:Ingenuity]]
[[Principles capture card:Disruptiveness]]
[[Tools capture card:Co-Creation and Validation of Improvement Interventions]]

[[7:27]]  
So this was taken into account by developing the models and was properly addressed and incorporated, calibrated within the model and the final outcome of the model is reliable and is ethical as far as we made effort to do so\.

[[7:43]]  
Great\.

[[7:44]]  
Well, I'm glad those principles were abided and guided in\.

[[7:48]]  
What were the skills perhaps that were needed to effectively identify your R&D work?

[[Skills capture card:System analysis and complex design]]
[[Principles capture card:Accessibility of knowledge]]
[[Skills capture card:Systems Mapping]]
[[Skills capture card:Collective Intelligence]]

[[7:56]]  
Yes, we have expertise within the team in data science, AI technology, machine learning, non traditional sources analysis and we also have programming skills such as coding with open to public software, Python, R, Julia and so on\.

[[Tools capture card:Innovation Challenge merged with blended financing]]
[[Skills capture card:Making insights actionable]]
[[Tools capture card:Data analysis, Machine learning, evidence based methods, survey (EPCV DHS)]]
[[Tools capture card:Innovative approach - Design Thinking - Issue Mapping - Stakeholder Mapping]]

[[8:15]]  
So we combined all those methods, analytics, data analysis, machine learning, data and so on to come up with this idea and develop such a platform\.

[[Skills capture card:Digital Skills]]
[[Skills capture card:Collective intelligence, video, visibility was key success, "press advisor"]]
[[Skills capture card:Imagination]]
[[Skills capture card:Collective Intelligence]]

[[8:29]]  
Apart from, let's say the data skills, were there other skills that were essential in the journey?

[[Principles capture card:Collaboration]]
[[Skills capture card:Collective intelligence, video, visibility was key success, "press advisor"]]
[[Principles capture card:Empathy]]
[[Skills capture card:System analysis and complex design]]

[[8:36]]  
Yes, I can cite among those skills, soft skills that were essential to make sure that there is a consultation and collaboration and a positive environment in implementing the intervention within the team\.

[[Principles capture card:Collaboration]]
[[Skills capture card:Sharing Knowledge, training, and unusual partnership]]
[[Principles capture card:Trust]]
[[Skills capture card:Cross agency partnership]]

[[8:51]]  
So I can cite the collaborative spirit, teamwork and the trustworthiness that is spilled over across the the team and those are essential soft skills that need to be considered in any project implementation\.

[[9:06]]  
Excellent and all right\.

[[Tactics capture card:De-risking the intervention by promoting an incremental approach through R&amp;D]]
[[Skills capture card:Communication, partnership, public relations]]
[[Skills capture card:Collective intelligence, video, visibility was key success, "press advisor"]]
[[Skills capture card:Time Management and adaptability]]

[[9:09]]  
So in terms of the R&D work, just reflecting on sort of the impacts and outcomes, what were they, what were they in terms of your RNG journey, what were the impacts or outcomes of your work?

[[9:24]]  
Well, this is an ongoing work, but we have what we call the expected outcome\.

[[Principles capture card:Inclusivity]]
[[Principles capture card:Transparency]]
[[Tactics capture card:Understanding the Community]]
[[Tools capture card:Data analysis, Machine learning, evidence based methods, survey (EPCV DHS)]]

[[9:29]]  
We expect that this platform would contribute to identify the vulnerable community within the country\.

[[Principles capture card:Even when the Lab is not there (or UNDP) things should continue - we have tâ€¦]]
[[Tactics capture card:Designing the pipelines]]
[[Skills capture card:Making insights actionable]]
[[Tools capture card:GIS system, qualitative interviews,system mapping, behavorial approach, ethnography, surveys, utilâ€¦]]

[[9:36]]  
It will have a an impact when it comes to the promotion of the livestock sector because identification of surface water is essential for livestock during the summer seasons and also will contribute in developing and modernizing the agricultural sectors\.

[[Principles capture card:Recognize local expertise: Nothing for us, without us]]
[[Skills capture card:Making insights actionable]]
[[Tools capture card:Innovative approach - Design Thinking - Issue Mapping - Stakeholder Mapping]]
[[Tactics capture card:Working with ecosystem]]

[[9:55]]  
As having idea on the agricultural potential within the country is essential for policy making and informed decision maker later on\.

[[Tools capture card:Headlines from the Future]]
[[Tools capture card:Innovation Ecosystem Map]]
[[Tools capture card:UNDP Foresight Playbook]]
[[Tools capture card:Innovation Challenge]]

[[10:04]]  
So we expect that this platform, if taken into scale and updated with relevant and pertinent information will have a significant repercussion and impact on the country and development objective within the country\.

[[10:20]]  
Great\.

[[10:21]]  
Now I know it's not yet, you know, final, it's ongoing\.

[[10:25]]  
But if you would have thought of doing it again or start again, what would you?

[[10:31]]  
What would you have done differently?

[[Tools capture card:Quasi Experimental Design Processes]]
[[Tactics capture card:Have good references for your technical work]]
[[Tools capture card:Co-Creation and Validation of Improvement Interventions]]
[[Tools capture card:The Future, Backwards]]

[[10:34]]  
I will probably go through some technical procedures, some technical process, modify some technical inputs to the model and make it much more precise\.

[[Principles capture card:Recognize local expertise: Nothing for us, without us]]
[[Skills capture card:Making insights actionable]]
[[Skills capture card:System analysis and complex design]]
[[Tools capture card:Innovative approach - Design Thinking - Issue Mapping - Stakeholder Mapping]]

[[10:52]]  
I will also consider adding more expert to the project just to make sure that I have a full picture of a proper implementation of the project and making leveraging the existing expertise within the within the team and also beyond the team to make sure that we have a proper product that is capable of predicting the outcome as precise as possible\.

[[11:17]]  
Precision seems to be the key here\.

[[11:20]]  
All right\.

[[Tactics capture card:De-risking the intervention by promoting an incremental approach through R&amp;D]]
[[Principles capture card:Collaboration]]
[[Principles capture card:It's not personal]]
[[Skills capture card:Community Engament]]

[[11:20]]  
So in terms of diffusion and catalyzation, did you have any strategies or approaches that you did to facilitate this or adopt your R&D journey or RND work?

[[Tools capture card:Citizen Science and gamification using digital platform to crowdsource solutions]]
[[Tools capture card:Innovation Challenge merged with blended financing]]
[[Tools capture card:Innovation Ecosystem Map]]
[[Principles capture card:Trust and Authenticity: Build trust as a must]]

[[11:35]]  
Sorry, yes, we're actually thinking about developing an online platform that makes this platform open to public\.

[[Tactics capture card:Creating space for emerging themes]]
[[Principles capture card:Transparency and Honesty: Be open, transparent, honest]]
[[Principles capture card:Disruptiveness]]
[[Principles capture card:Inclusivity]]

[[11:42]]  
So everyone can make use of it and exploit it as far as they are concerned with their thematics\.

[[Tools capture card:Citizen Science and gamification using digital platform to crowdsource solutions]]
[[Tools capture card:UNDP Foresight Playbook]]
[[Tools capture card:Future Backwards]]
[[Tools capture card:The Future, Backwards]]

[[11:49]]  
So I think we will, we are about we are thinking about developing an online platform upon which we can upload this platform and make it available for everyone\.

[[Tools capture card:Headlines from the Future]]
[[Tools capture card:UNDP Foresight Playbook]]
[[Tools capture card:Citizen Science and gamification using digital platform to crowdsource solutions]]
[[Skills capture card:Collective intelligence, video, visibility was key success, "press advisor"]]

[[11:59]]  
And this will will also contribute in like spreading the information and also maximizing the use of this platform, which will will amplify the impact that it might have on development in the country\.

[[12:14]]  
And overall great\.

[[12:17]]  
Well, thank you Nisa, thank you for sharing\.

[[12:20]]  
But that concludes the interview\.

[[12:22]]  
Thank you so much\.

[[12:23]]  
I appreciate it pleasure\.

[[12:24]]  
Thank you for having me\.
