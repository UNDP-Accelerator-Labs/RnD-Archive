# [OLD] Open data in Argentina

### [[0:00]]How are you today?
Fine, Thank you. 

### You're looking very nice.
Thank you.

### [[0:07]]So, give us a bit about your name and position.
OK. I'm Maria Lopez. I am the Head of Exploration of Argentina.

### [[0:16]]Excellent. So, do you want to share one of your R&D stories with us?
[[skills:Analysing large datasets]]
[[tools:Open data]]
Yes, I am working in a data visualization contest with partner with Data Science Lab of University of San Andres and the Secretary of Science in Argentina. The idea is to well to launch this data visualization contest in order to use the open data that is available. The government has a lot of data sets, but the private sector is the user mostly.
So, the idea is to engage people, to engage students, to engage like everybody, to appropriate all those data and try to like find patterns and use it as a device of exploration. Then we are going to give them input like webinars and tools to try to use the data to create compelling visualizations and try to, for example, using positive deviance to find what's going on, like what, what, what's going, what, what works in Argentina.
So, we are going to try to use this contest as a like as a collective intelligence tool to find information and patterns in this open data.

### [[1:40]]Great. So who are your target demographic for this data visualization challenge?
[[skills:Visualizing open data]]
Well, the public like the participants. It's for everybody. But mostly I think that they are going to be students from universities. But the idea is that whoever wants could participate. And the idea is to not only have like data scientist or more like scientific profiles, but also we want to try to convince people from designers and artists, because we want to try to, to, to build this idea that data is beautiful. And that you can, you can really, I don't know, you can really, if you mix art with data, you can convey a very powerful message.
So, the idea is to try to broaden our audience, not only for data scientists or for economics, but but also for everybody.

### [[2:42]]Wow, sounds really exciting and intriguing. So, what are your tactics or key approaches for attracting your target demographic?
Well, I think that the input that we have like in social media, and in real physical events, it's a mandatory, like you wish to, we should try to give examples of good visualizations and attractive visualizations. And also we are going to give like talks and, and workshops like, because sometimes when you design A contest, maybe it's like, OK, I will, I participate, I want to win.
I don't know a computer or whatever, but you need you need input like you need to to to take away something about from the contest too.
So, we are going to create a like a festival of daytime art. And the idea is to invite all the experts and speakers and like a very diverse speakers and, and, and whoever wants to come can have a like, a more like the feeling of what's the idea of the contest?

### [[3:57]]Excellent. Who are you thinking about having as judges panel?
Oh, we have a, a graphic designer that he's a data specialist too. And he, he's very good with, he's very creative with the visualization that he creates. So, probably we are going to ask him not only to be one of the of the judges, but also he probably will give like a membership.
So yep. And we have a computer scientist too, but also we have communicators and artists.

### [[4:32]]OK, so diverse panel as well. Excellent. So what are the skills that you think would come handy in getting this initiative successfully?
I think that the first skill is that I really believe in that. Like I, I think that it's really important. We have, we live in a world surrounded by information. We are creating data all the time and we don't, we don't know what happened with data and data is power. So, I think that sharing that, that power, it's mandatory. We, we should do that.
So, I think that I start convincing people because I truly believe that this is important. 
So, I think that the skill for things to happen is that you, you really have to believe that that's what you are doing. It's important. And I think that the contest, it's a device, it’s a way to achieve this. And also I am eager to see the, the outcomes and the products and, we are going then it's, it's information that we can use also for keep going in, in research like it opens doors.
And I think that the skill that I use is communicating with enthusiasm. And when I, the first time that I called the university, they say, let's do this data solution contest. And I think that they will say, yes, let's do this because it's, when you are enthusiastic for something, it's contagious. And now everybody's on board.

### [[6:09]]Great. So, what does a successful what would be the success outcomes of this initiative and what do you see as next step?
The success would be if a lot of people participate, like and if we have if we can continue doing this and if the information then we get then it's travel. And like if, if I think that the yes, the success would look like if we have a lot of participants and also a lot of like a lot of people who maybe want to do this, but now they are motivated and do it. 
So, it's like a push a little, a little nudge.

### [[6:56]]Yep. Excellent. Thank you.
Thank you.
