# Experimenter-The Gambia-Marie Mendi

### [[0:00]] All right, tell me your name, your title, and say I give consent to this recording\.

My name is Marie\. My name is Marie Mehndi and I am the head of experimentation of the Gambia Accelerator Lab\. And I give content to this interview\.

### [[0:26]] Great\. All right\. Let's start out with R&D activity\.

### [[0:30]] Could you tell me about an R&D activity that you would like to share?

[[tactics:Setting up the first block of the pyramid]]
[[skills:Creativity, organisation, open mind]]
[[tactics:De-risking the intervention by promoting an incremental approach through R&amp;D]]
[[principles:Ingenuity]]
OK\. Given the fact that I just started with the Accelerator lab in May, I was actually going through induction and orientation process the last month and I have in mind an R&D activity that I want to conduct after the school first in The Gambia\. The R&D activity is to map the IS on secular economy, to map the secular economy ecosystem which will be the first in the country, map the secular economy ecosystem in the country by and then conduct a secular economy challenge for this ecosystem\. So this is the R&D activity that I want to commence once return\.

### [[1:32]] All right, that sounds good\. Yeah\. What is the development issue that you're addressing? What's the situation?

[[skills:Curiosity, Humble, community participation, Leadership, innovation]]
[[tactics:Share your value upfront, not budget]]
[[skills:Creativity, organisation, open mind]]
[[tools:Collective Intelligence]]
Yeah, the situation\. Gambia has a waste management problem\. Yeah\. So we have AI think around in in the community that I want to conduct the sex R&D activity is we have around less than 20 dump, dump sites which is really small compared to the waste that that is generated in the country\. And then we have a lot of waste people dumping here and there and it is really not coordinated\. So waste is a really a problem which is causing pollution in the country, waste pollution particularly\. So bringing this mapping the the the the youth that are interested in this secular economy will also help us, you know, come up with a challenge as to how do we address this development issue\. How can they come up with solution so as to address this issues? And also it will also give them these solutions after being, you know, after the challenge\. It will also give them a sense of employment after being sorry\. Sense of employment, Yes\. OK, So this challenge will help us the, the, the, the, the, the youth in the circular economy ecosystem will help to roll out innovative solutions to address this development issue\. And also will give them the, the opportunity to start working on either recycling, recycling, reusing this waste product to, to, to, for them to say, like, I think I'm really impressed with how this the, the, this country is working on, you know, reusing, recycling their, their waste products\. So I think that it would really be a good idea to start in the Gambia mapping this ecosystem, bringing up this challenge to for the youth\. And then also at the end of the day will give them the employment or that would generate income for the youth that are not working\.

### [[4:19]] Yeah, that's great\. How would you ensure diverse stakeholder perspectives? What role do you envision stakeholders having?

[[principles:Recognize and promote agency: Enable agency, the greatest choice for the greatest number]]
[[principles:Transparency]]
[[tools:Citizen Science and gamification using digital platform to crowdsource solutions]]
[[principles:Inclusivity]]
I think the stakeholders are really important in this\. First of all, the youth ministry trying to bring out they have a database of youth in different sectors\. But then again, this circular economy is a big new in our country\. So having the, the, the, the, the ministry of youth that has this database of youth that are, let me say, environment champions, bringing out this youth and also getting their, their participation will really be crucial\. And also they the conducting visits, stakeholder engagement with our National Environment Agency for their commitment and their participation\. Also the the, the enforcers, the police creating 'cause they will have a unit in the police that helps in creating awareness, encouraging the communities also in this waste management, secular economy sector, imagine sector in our country\. Yeah, stakeholder engagement with all these partners and not forgetting UNDP to the country office to also be part of it, to be committed and also support in the support in creating awareness in also the the the communities\. I think that is really crucial\.

### [[6:05]] Let's talk about skills\. What skills are needed to identify and understand the challenges with R&D?

[[tactics:Understanding the Community]]
[[skills:Curiosity, Humble, community participation, Leadership, innovation]]
[[tools:Increasing community engagement through community-growing incentives]]
[[principles:Recognize and promote agency: Enable agency, the greatest choice for the greatest number]]
Yes, with the stakeholder engagement, I forgot the community\. So it's really important to include the community\. So the skills I would say communication skills, going out to the community, engaging them and also making environment champion in the community, talking about waste, how they can recycle\. I even took this bag that the guy from Philippine brought the post\. So to show them that this is what you can do out of the way\. So I am going down to the communities, I am talking to them, sensitizing them about waste management and also bringing the youth, youth together to also support in creating also communication will really be crucial in in this in this activity\.

### [[7:05]] Well, we can't talk about outcomes, but I think we did you did cover how this work would impact sustainable development\. So let's say what strategies or approaches will you employ to facilitate diffusion and adoption of R&D outcomes?

[[tactics:Design the narrative flow and the stage to ensure the community and the desired outcome lead]]
[[tools:Innovative approach - Design Thinking - Issue Mapping - Stakeholder Mapping]]
[[skills:Creativity, organisation, open mind]]
[[tactics:Gaining Leverage and Traction for solutions]]
OK, So the methodology, methodologies or the strategies is to the first thing is to engage the the municipality for sustainability and also for for their commitment\. So this will help in, you know, catalyzing this secular economy, mapping circular economy activities to other regions in the country\. So engaging this municipal municipality, our area council leaders to join in this development solution challenge would really be crucial\.

### [[8:20]] OK\. What about what that you talked about engaging with policy makers, any engagement with the private sector?

Yes, the private sector would really engaging with the private sector, Yes, plan to engage with the private sector\.

### [[8:39]] OK\. What about we talked about tools and skills, what about principles, what ethical considerations or principles of inclusivity, equity or sustainability guides this R&D approach?

[[principles:Partnership]]
[[principles:Collaboration]]
[[tools:Scaling partnerships by demonstrating value incrementally]]
[[skills:Sharing Knowledge, training, and unusual partnership]]
The first thing is partnership, like like I said, collaborating with the stakeholders for their for their participation to this development challenge\.

### [[9:22]] Also, what about principles related to work? You mentioned young people, correct? What about principles related to working with young people, for example, I'm just thinking off the top of my head, you're asking young people to volunteer their time, but yet maybe many are unemployed, something like that\. Are there approaches that you want to take with regards to the stakeholders and to youth and to those committing to this path?

Yes\. The first thing is to be be clear about everything about this, how this this R&D activity will address challenges, waste challenges in our country and how it can also they can also use this as an opportunity to create\. It can also be like an opportunity for them to create means of generating income like reusing the waste that is being generated, recycling\.

### [[11:02]] Is there anything else that you can think of that you want to share, share this or is there any? Are you or do you feel embedded within the country office? For example, do you feel, what do you feel is the importance, let's say of the a bit of the labs being embedded in the country office?

Yes, I think one thing about the lab being embedded or the labs that that is really a positive thing is our resident coordinator is really a nut lab champion\. Yeah\. she's always there trying to push us to do, to do and to bring up an innovative ideas using our CPD, collaborating with our C country office and different clusters\. So I think she's one person that is really pushing this Akla and she believes in the the capacity of the Akla\. So that is one and also the country office ready to collaborate with us\. Like I said with this circular economy R&D activity that I plan to do, I met with the environment cluster and they told me that they have this, but they have not yet started\. So I said, OK, why not collaborate together and then see how to roll out this thing in innovative using innovative at lab ways and they agreed to it\.
