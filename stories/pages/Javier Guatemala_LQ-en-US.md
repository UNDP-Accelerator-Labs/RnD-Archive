# Experimenter\-Guatemala\-Javier Brolo

### [[0:00]] All right, please tell me your name, your title and say I consent to this recording\.

My name is Javier Brolo\. I am the Head of experimentation in the Accelerator Lab in Guatemala, and I consent to this interview over to you\.

### [[0:20]] All right\. Could you please tell me about an R&D activity that you'd like to share and how you came up, how it came about South?

[[principles:Collaboration]]
[[principles:Inclusivity and diversity]]
[[principles:Diversity]]
[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
The research and development activity I would like to share is an effort that we've been doing on what can be done to address polarization\. So that, you know, dialogue and collaboration are stagnated by polarization\. And we need dialogue and collaboration to be able to face together development challenges that cannot be solved by one person alone\. So the actually the research and development activity came about through the opportunity to localize the global development report who addressed this very issue\. So it gave us a prompt to be able to make it relevant to the organization and address this direct problem in Guatemala\. So dialogue, how to promote dialogue and collaboration, overcoming polarization\.


### [[1:26]] Yeah\. And what specific development issue is this addressing? And yeah, what, what did the situation look like?

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[principles:Self-awareness]]
[[principles:Always increase social capital]]
[[principles:Curiosity]]
So very specifically, these addresses the, the ah, the problem of, of peace, the sustainable development goal about peace\. The situation that we have now is that political scenarios have become very polarized to the point where it's not only that people have different ideas is that people are aggressive to others in outer groups\. So anything that needs a consensus to make a decision or a policy, it gets stuck\. It gets stuck because we focused more on our differences than the need and the shared problem that we need to solve\. So that's the development problem is how do we enable society to work together because we know we cannot solve things on our own\. And the situation now is so problematic that we were even at the point of not being able to do a democratic transition, a peaceful democratic transition because groups with the power to make decisions are against each other\. Yes\. So it's the situation now\.


### [[2:46]] OK\. So who did you work with on this organization issue and how did you ensure that relevant, all the relevance and the best stakeholders were involved?

[[principles:Inclusivity and diversity]]
[[principles:Diversity]]
[[principles:Recognize and promote agency]]
[[principles:Human centering and adaptability]]
So what we did from the get go was to try to gather those people who had had experiences trying to sustain dialogue and collaboration in very difficult context\. And we tried to diversify the most amount of context\. So we brought together people who had been involved in dialogues during the armed conflict in Guatemala, for example, but also people who have been involved in trying to promote economic reforms, which have been difficult\. Also people from academia, people from anthropology and sociology who have been mediating dialogues with indigenous communities, people from youth, people from gender issues, people from political science, people from diplomacy and international relations\. So we gather a group of people who didn't know each other, but all recognize the expertise and the value that each others have had in their contributions to sustain dialogue in these important processes throughout the recent history in Guatemala\. And it proved to be very enriching\.


### [[4:03]] Good to hear that\. And So what tools and methods did you use and why did you say so in order to come up with a collective solution to solve the to address polarization and recommendations, We did a lot of research\.

[[tools:GIS systems]]
[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[tools:Design]]
[[tools:Human centered design]]
So first we researched what kind of methodologies we're going to be able to give us recommendations\. At first, we were looking at how to characterize polarization in Guatemala so that we could identify who are the actors and what positions they have on certain issues so that maybe we could develop a strategy to bring those differences together\. But this was very risky because it was very difficult to characterize the positions of people without misrepresenting it\. So we instead looked for innovative solutions that could help us look into the future\. So we researched many tools and methods, and we came across a tool to develop future scenarios and stress test recommendations\. So how to address polarization in different scenarios of polarization? On top of that, we did a lot because we're going to be dealing with people who had a large amount of expertise and are motivated by gaining new information and networking\. We made sure to do our homework\. So we use some tools to research and analyze public opinion data that could help us lay the grounds to come up to implement these recommendations\.


### [[5:31]] Interesting\. And so what were these approaches that you used to engage these stakeholders?

[[principles:Trust]]
[[principles:Transparency and Honesty]]
[[principles:Prioritize transparency in methods and openness in sharing data and results]]
[[principles:Inclusivity]]
Because we were dealing with a very delicate topic\. We need to create a space that was trust that we're trust\. So I had the opportunity, and this is a serendipity coincidence of having been able through previous experiences, interact, attend conferences of different people, read their books, engage in a project, all separate\. But the tactic that we use is that we had some kind of previous personal relation, which is, which is of these actors\. So they all trusted the person that was doing the gathering inviting, even though they didn't know each other\. And we also made sure to create the space where any differences were managed so that the emotions were sort of kept at a professional level\. And that help us bring together these diverse group of people on a very sensitive topic where people want to listen more than share\.


### [[6:42]] Yeah, it's good that you used your network and to engage them\.

Yeah, we had a very controversial former president of Congress, for example, and people who have been advocates in activism and journalists also talking with private sector like big corporations all in the same place\. So we needed to have a personal connection that was longer in time than this just single conversation\.

### [[7:12]] Yes\. Were there any principles that were relevant and that you applied in this activity?

[[principles:Trust]]
[[principles:Transparency and Honesty]]
[[principles:Prioritize transparency in methods and openness in sharing data and results]]
[[principles:Accessibility of knowledge]]
Definitely all the principles about ethics and being transparent and giving back to the people, the products and the results of that they were speaking in order to, to gain trust\. It's very important that action is coherent with what you're saying\. So everything was public\. People had access to this information\. We gave back all the reports and we made sure that they had their consent and we were there to listen to their experiences and learn from them and not coming with a top down approach\. I'd say those are the main principles in this experience, yes\.


### [[8:06]] Yeah\. And then in terms of skills, which skills were useful to properly understand the challenge and address it\.

[[skills:Conceptualizing skill]]
[[tools:GIS systems]]
[[skills:Foresight]]
[[tools:Human centered design]]
So we needed the facilitation skills to be able to bring together the people, and then we needed some data analysis skills to be able to gather and create the information to begin with\. And then I'll say the sensemaking skill\. That was a tool that was very useful\. And I think there are many ways to synthesize the conclusions of what people are saying, but we're able to integrate into a coherent recommendation that makes sense and represented people\. It's a soft skill and an analytical skill that was very important\.


### [[9:00]] So if you reflect on the, on that activity, what is the outcome? What is the outcome of it and how does it impact?

[[principles:Inclusivity]]
[[principles:Inclusivity and diversity]]
[[principles:Diversity]]
[[principles:Collaboration]]
So I think there are two main outcomes from these research and development exercise\. Remember, we're trying to know how to promote dialogue and collaboration that overcomes polarization\. So the 1st result was a more diverse complete understanding of what drives polarization, but focused on an understanding that enable alternatives way of acting\. So most people would start by thinking that polarization is caused by misinformation\. People are misguided\. They probably more agree in more agreements that they realize, but because they have wrong information, then they will clash\. But this result was very useful because it offered other opportunities to act like promoting Internet interpersonal relationships, like understanding the role of emotions and how to manage them\. Also, you understanding that the problematic messages is not that they're wrong, but that they evoke fear and anger, which is different because even if you provide correct information, it's difficult to overcome the effect of fear and anger\. So I would say that's a main result\. But also there were recommendations on what to do not only in scenarios of polarizations that are difficult and challenging, but also do not miss opportunities because we cannot treat everything as if it was highly polarized\. So there were very good recommendations on the importance of sensitivity when polarization is high, managing the emotions that are difficult, following the rules, managing the expectations, but also in in scenarios of opportunity to increase the number of people who can participate and diversify those people, maybe use digital tools and you can even be disruptive\. So identifying that there are also opportunities I think was a valuable result\.


### [[11:15]] OK, now knowing what you do now about promoting dialogue to reduce polarization, what would you do differently if you were to do it over again?

[[tools:Design]]
[[tactics:Systems thinking]]
[[principles:Flexibility and adaptability]]
[[tools:GIS systems]]
I think we worked a lot in trying to develop a methodology that will give us scenarios and we adapted it and we, we didn't ever had enough time\. So simplifying and now that we've had the experience, we know what things are relevant and what things we weren't able to get to\. So I would say that and also I think it will be useful to replicate this exercise to give it more robustness\. We have a very diverse group to start with, but I think having more groups will probably enrich the recommendations even more and the understanding\.


### [[12:08]] Are there any strategies or approaches that you used to ensure that this approach to promoting dialogue for addressing polarization is scaled?

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[tactics:Getting in there]]
[[principles:Recognize and promote agency]]
[[tactics:Systems thinking]]
Yes\. So now that we have this result, we're moving forward with trying to increment the capacity of public institutions to implement these recommendations\. So we we've had few champions within the executive that have become very interested in increasing the capacity of the personal\. And basically we are running exercises where we're public officials who have the responsibility to deal with polarization, but may not have the training now gain a greater understanding of how polarization is affecting their work directly and then identifying actions that can be effective but also doable\. So we're focusing on what each public official can do and not what they think someone else could do\. And we've replicated this with over 20 institutions now\. And we're also trying to increase the capacity of the people so that the institutions can run it on their own\. And we've got the buy in of the president to take up all these recommendations and present them in a big event, an agenda that that has the support of the leadership of the government and encourages people to move in that direction\. So we are going to be able to make the voices of public officers heard and at the same time gain their commitment and the capacity for them to do it on their own\.


### [[13:54]] OK\. Beyond this, getting the last question, are there any engagements, whether with policymakers or other communities and other stakeholders that you have done or planning to do to impact this challenge on a broader scale?

[[principles:Recognize and promote agency]]
[[principles:Immersion and engagemen]]
[[principles:Transparency and Honesty]]
[[principles:Prioritize transparency in methods and openness in sharing data and results]]
So we've, we've engaged public officials from multiple institutions\. But now that you ask, I will add 2\. So the people who participated in the exercise, this group of experts in dialogue are now taking in these results and bringing them to their own spaces\. So the economist with people in the economist community, the anthropologist with people in the anthropologist community, the youth with the people in the youth community\. And I also think a key actor that was engaged was a digital journalist who is a bit disruptive\. So it was slightly risky to engage, but it gave credibility and it gave the opportunity for people to notice the value of these recommendations\.


### [[15:08]] Thank you so much for your time and for sharing these insights\.
