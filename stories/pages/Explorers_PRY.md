# Stitching Change Together

### [[0:07]] Yeah, Just as a nice way of starting, can you please introduce yourself, tell us your name and your position\.

OK, I'm Monica on the Explorer of Faraway\.
OK, Monica, just relax\.

### [[0:24]] This is a normal interview and you would like to know more about you tell me any developing issue that you are doing that can involve R&D practice that that you are doing current so that we can know more about your activities at the lab\.

I don't know it's it, it's hard to pick something, but I will try to be kind of specific about it\.  
So it's is more easy to relate with and far away\.  
We work with frontier challenges\.  
One of them is formalization\.  
We did a sense making exercise in 2019 and this is one, this is one that we pick up and we have this learning loop that is called a local\.  
Local in English is now the same that is focus on improving and productive and working conditions for garment worships and three cities 3 clusters in around Paraway\.  
And it's really interesting because we we got the chance to work with different ministries\.  
We work with the minute with the labor ministry, we work with the Commerce and Industry ministry and of course the Carmen worships and the local governments of the cities and, and it's a learning loop that also have some additional funds\.  
And so it, it's, it's a bigger group\.  
It's not only the three of us as as a lab, we have a group of consultants around six people and that help us and we kinda have and we've been working on this for eight months now\.  
So it's kind of bigger than the usual loop\.  
You know, we tried to stay for six months long in each loop\.  
So this one is kind of bigger\.  
So it makes it a little bit more interesting thing\.

### [[2:34]] Thank you\. Can you please tell us the, the role of the, all the stakeholders that you mentioned the role?

First of all, they just allowed us to, to work there\.  
I, I think they're interested enough about the work we want to do, the learning that we want to do\.  
And I think they're interested about the, the data that we are able to produce and share with all of them\.  
And especially then the garment industry is, is an area that the, the Ministry of Commerce is really interested about and, and the working conditions is another thematic area that the Labor ministry is interested\.  
So we kind of develop this learning loop that I think is right in the middle of these two interested interests, interests of these two ministries\.  
So I think it's good opportunity of learning and and bring these two big, big offices to to collaborate\.  
I think\.

[[principles:Give the space to others to shine]]

### [[3:41]] So during our conversation you mentioned about sense making\. Can you please tell us more about tools and methods that you use and why?

And tools of and methods around this learning loop\.  
I will say that for starts, it will be just data\.  
We started with some surveys, interviews and census around this, these garment workshops and these clusters that we want to work with and we can analyze the previous work that has been done with other international corporations and learn from them, interview them and and build up from from that, we have been able to develop 3 senses in each city around almost 400 Carmen workshops and analyzes data, socialize it with the Carmen workshops\.  
And besides that, we've been developing this lock\.  
How do you say this lock book like observations during the interventions that are really, really rich?  
I mean, they're really detailed about the conditions of these garment workshops\.  
And I think those are, they maybe sound pretty basic, but they're really detailed\.  
They, they can really show the face of these interventions of these people that are working there and they're giving some really interesting insights for us to work and continue and, and kind of helping us and pointing out the, the design\.  
And I'm thinking about when you asked me about stakeholders, I forgot a big one\.  
We're working with the private sector as well because these government workshops work as a providers of an anchor companies\.  
And we selected also these 5 anchor companies and that are being working\.  
They have been working with, with us all through the, the learning circle\.  
So I forgot about them\.

[[tactics:Gaining Leverage and Traction for solutions]]

### [[6:02]] OK, no worries\. Can you please tell us what tactics and approach did you use to engage your stakeholders? Is there any special way of to address them? Can you please share with us?

Oh my God, I think I shared a little bit\.  
I think it was mostly about being at the right with the right speech at the right time\.  
I mean, this is thematic area that is important for the government and we propose a learning loop that brings additional data we wanted to build up from the the previous work\.  
We weren't trying to sell anything new\.  
We, we were really interested about, we were what has been already done and just curious about what knowledge we can bring to the table\.  
What, what interventions can we actually be done that will be bringing additional information, You know, just not doing the same\.  
The, the, the scale of our intervention actually allow us to fail, allow us to, to learn\.  
And I think that was an important message and not only for the government but for the, the anchor companies as well, because some of them were kind of the anchor companies\.  
I think they were the most, the most happy about it because they were usually, they felt so alone about the, the, the relationship with this garment warships and the government is sometimes they, they feel so and they felt this distance between them\.  
You know, they don't feel they have enough spaces to have a sincere conversation about the needs and etcetera\.  
So I think we, we approach them separately\.  
We've, we've been genuine about what we can offer and what we expect from the, from the learning loop, from the circumstances about the timing that we have, the resources that we have\.  
And I think that that pay off in terms of the sincerity that we received\.  
And I don't know the dynamics\.  
It felt really genuine\.

### [[8:42]] So now thank you so much\. You also end up guiding me to the next question that is related with principles that guide you for this work, the the learning process\. Can you please give us more, more details because you have started to talk about the honesty, the ways that you approach the government\. Can you please go in more details like maybe ethical considerations that during the process, principles of inclusive equity, sustainable guides, you can give more details on that\.

Yes, yes, of course\.  
I think, I think that for us, the, the, the two main beneficiaries are of course, the, the garment worships and the and the private sector and for the garment worships is the principle of do not harm\.  
I mean, we are entering their homes and most of them have the the garment worship in their houses or next to their houses where they entering their homes and asking them a lot of questions about how they live, if they're big taxes or where exposing them at some level\.  
And it was really important for us for them to feel that, for them to know what we're gonna do with their information and, and why we're asking all these questions, not asking too much and just asking enough so we can do our work and not and, and being considered about, I don't know, explaining the intervention, how much time it will take for them to participate\.  
And then to acknowledge and actually upset this, this proposal and understand it very, very well before start, not just doing and then realize it that they, they, they can do it anymore on being exhausted about it\.  
I don't know\.  
It was very important for us that part because we have seen it in, in other than Lucy\.  
Sometimes it's not, I don't know you, you don't mean you don't mean to do that, but sometimes it just happens\.  
And the other and about the the private sector for us, I think it was about building this, this conscious, this mutual, this this sense of corporate social responsibility that actually engage the community that actually brings up includes a voice of the Carmen worships into their their way of doing things, not just bought and off and you know, just include them in some way\.

### [[11:35]] Thank you\. Let's go to the next question\. What skills were needed to effectively identify and understand the challenge or the needs for this process of learning?

[[tools:Scaling partnerships by demonstrating value incrementally]]
[[tools:NESTA's Collective Intelligence Design Playbook]]
[[tools:Collective Intelligence for climate action]]
[[tools:Collaborative design of actions]]
So many, so many\.  
I mean, yeah, yes, yes, yes\.  
Then the team, I think we were so lucky\.  
The team was big enough\.  
We have some help\.  
We were able to actually added some some more people to team\.  
And I mean in the club in Paraguay, I mean, I have I have a business background\.  
Christian the experimenter is, has a science technology background\.  
Ceci, which is a mapper, has a political background\.  
And we added some more people, some experts on, on manufacturing, garment communication and social work and social work\.  
And I'm missing someone\.  
I design, I design\.  
Yeah, yes, a a designer as well\.  
And this and this team really help the really bring into the intervention some really brother, really, really\.  
I had a missing a word I can understand like deep understand of the situation\.  
Yeah, really colorful or really I don't know\.  
There were many, many voices around how the same situation seems to variety of solutions\.  
Yeah, exactly\.  
OK, we can go to number four\.  
Yes, last question reflecting your journal, Can you please tell us the impact, the outcome, what was the impact of that beautiful journal has a club team and what you can share with us?  
I mean this learning loop hasn't ended yet and we are just starting the monitoring and evaluating process\.  
The intervention just ended and we're hoping to being able to gather an evaluation report and we're just starting the interview\.  
So for us will be very, very important to giving back to the community through reports, to blogs, to some online and on site events in each city and in association with the ministries with the local communities as well\.  
And, and we hope that this knowledge of this information actually helps not only UNDP, but also the other international corporations and the ministries that actually help us build it learning loop in the 1st place and just build upon that\.

### [[14:26]] If you could do again, what would you do different if you would start again differently?

I had no idea\.  
Maybe\.  
I don't know, I suppose I don't think the context will ever be the same, but I think I'll, I don't know\.  
It's a difficult question because I'm not\.

### [[14:48]] Could you address the partners the same way? Could you take the same steps? I mean, I'm not proud of the mistakes that were made, but I'm happy that they happened because I learned\.

I mean we were have, we have a few steps that we have to take back and go back to the design table in terms of the role of the private sector, in terms of the improvement plan that we made with each garment workshop\.  
Because each of these garment workshops have this personalized improved plan that we followed through the around six months with each of them\.  
And all of these tools, I mean, they always have room for improvement\.  
And, but I, I think I, I don't regret any of the things that happen\.  
I think it's always wrong for\.

### [[15:45]] So for the, what does the strategy approach that you employed facilitated this process?

I mean, that's probably some of the, it's the status probably beginning right now\.  
And but then for us it was first of all involving the, the local government\.  
I mean, all of the data that we already developed is available available in the local government platforms, is available in UNDP platforms\.  
And we try to always everything that we publish to it in, in collaboration with their, with their and their platforms and the ministries if they're interested enough\.  
And blogs mostly blogs about the process, the solution, mapping, the sensors, the methodologies, how the improvement plan is being executed now\.

### [[16:47]] OK, this is the end of interview\. Thank you so much Monica, for your time and for your insights\. I hope to see you again in the next fest\.

Thank you, Juliet\.
