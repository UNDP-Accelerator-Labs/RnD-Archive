# Digitizing Justice with Empathy and Evidence in the DRC

### [[0:04]] Tell me, who are you? Inside UNDP and outside UNDP?

Yeah\.
My name is Serge Cucinza\.
I'm the head of exploration at Accelerator Lab, DRC Congo, the center of Africa\.

### [[0:19]] Can you tell me about your R&D activity, something that you'd like to share?

Yeah, I would like to share the the justice reform that we we've been privileged to be part of is about digitalizations of the justice sector\.
We are in a country where there's a serious lack of digitalization in the administration of justice\.
And this is making the justice very heavy and very difficult to to actually be productive to the people\.
And so we we had the chance to be partnered with the Ministry of Justice to help them put in place a system, a software that we designed and Co created with them\.
And for this is for the objective of actually being to to make the justice more efficient, more speedy, and also a more decision evidence decision based operations, because they don't have data to base the decisions for the future, for the management of the justice\.
So it was an interesting journey, by the way, wow, inspiring\.

### [[1:38]] And as an explorer in part Accelerator Lab, what did you do different from the other traditional developers or units inside UNDP? What are what Accelerator Lab make different?

[[skills:Design of experiments and how to monitor and evaluate them]]
[[principles:Even when the Lab is not there (or UNDP) things should continue - we have t…]]
[[tools:This inventory is about how you can use experiments to solve public and soc…]]
[[principles:Do no Harm]]
What the different we came with the element of experimentation\.
When I say experimentation, it it's taking into consideration the whole process of the lab as well, because there there is data involved, there is intelligence, collective intelligence involved\.
There is also some sort of surveys involved\.
So each of the lab people has had a key role to play and as explorer, we we, we had a focus on how to collect those data and actually to archive them and foresee how those data can be useful for justice management and decision making process\.

### [[2:41]]What are the learnings with this process that you can?

[[principles:Humain Centered Design]]
[[principles:Accessibility of knowledge]]
[[principles:Transparency]]
[[principles:Ingenuity]]
[[principles:Human centering and adaptability: Less of me, more of them]]
[[principles:Care about the people the same amount you care about the solutions]]
[[tools:Personas]]
[[tools:Human Centered Design (HCD) Workshop]]
[[tools:Collaborative design of actions]]
[[tools:Innovation Challenge]]
[[tools:UNDP Foresight Playbook]]
[[tools:Scaling partnerships by demonstrating value incrementally]]
[[tools:Systemic Design]]
[[skills:Making insights actionable]]
[[skills:Collective intelligence, video, visibility was key success, "press advisor"]]
Yes, it was a bit hectic at the beginning because there is resistance to change\.These are people that you that are used for with paper based processes and the you, you come with the technology, a software that they need to actually adopt\.
And for them is a change change, a serious change happening\.
So there was a push back, but we managed actually to find champions within the administration who are more tech, tech savvy to drive the change within the administration\.And the method that we used, which is human centric design helped us also empowered them, empowered them in the sense that they had the ownership of the the design process from the base to the top\.
So they are the one designing all the framing, etcetera\.
We just had the developer in the process who helped us materialize what was their their ideas and how they wanted to function, were they just to accompany them and with with methods, etcetera\.
So that's helped us to to hack the system and to have a higher rate of adoption of those those software later on\.

### [[4:04]] In what phase are you now? Where do you consider?

[[principles:Transparency]]
[[principles:Disruptiveness]]
[[skills:Making insights actionable]]
[[tactics:Build momentum]]
[[tactics:De-risking the intervention by promoting an incremental approach through R&amp;D]]
[[tactics:Design the narrative flow and the stage to ensure the community and the desired outcome lead]]

[[tools:The Future, Backwards]]
[[tools:Innovation Challenge]]
[[tools:Scenario analysis]]
[[tools:Systemic Design]]
I would say we are at the face of mid scaling\.
I would say mid scaling because our country is a very big country\.
It's 2\.3 million kilometer square million kilometer square meter, which is very huge\.
We so far we have covered 8 provinces\.
So there is a a lot of, a lot of work to do to to you actually cover all the country\.
But this helped us also to build like a momentum to show that this is the way to go to the government\.
So it's a kind of use case for them to actually see if they can mobilize resources to to expand the solution all over the country\.

### [[4:54]] So and what are the the main Methodist that you are using now or the tactics that for you to speed up and be able to go to all the kind, what are making you able to do this scale up phase?

[[principles:Human centering and adaptability: Less of me, more of them]]
[[principles:Even when the Lab is not there (or UNDP) things should continue - we have t…]]
[[principles:Ingenuity]]
[[principles:Recognize local expertise: Nothing for us, without us]]
[[principles:Recognize and promote agency: Enable agency, the greatest choice for the greatest number]]
[[principles:Transparency]]
[[principles:Disruptiveness]]
[[principles:Ingenuity]]
[[skills:Making insights actionable]]
[[tactics:Understanding the Community]]
[[tools:Collaborative design of actions]]
[[tools:Collective intelligence]]
Yes, what we do we did is first of all, we empower the user themselves to be the trainers in the system\.
That's number one\.
But also we, we are going to meet the local authorities where we want to actually deploy to raise awareness and to get the ownership of the process\.
And that's helped a lot\.
Luckily for us, the the the high authority in justice supporting the process and these three elements actually is the combo that we use to to be relevant in the process\.

### [[5:53]] Congratulations\. Just to close, do you want to add something or give a message to the other?

[[principles:Human centering and adaptability: Less of me, more of them]]
Yeah, we I would say stay passionate and persistent in what you believe in and you must actually embedded in yourself into the convincing mode anytime around the process that you are championing\.
That's the the advice that I will give you guys\.

### [[6:28]] Thank you\.

Thank you so much\.
