# Solutions Mapper-Bosnia and Herzegovina-Amina Omicevic

## [[0:00]] Good afternoon\. I'll start by first asking you what is your name and your position\.

I'm Amino Omicevic, Head of Solutions Mapping in the Accelerator, Bosnia and Herzegovina\.

## [[0:12]] OK, that's great\. So today I want to ask you, could you give us an R&D story that you would wish to share a little title and maybe a short description?

Yes\. I will tell you a short story about an A learning journey on urban transformation in one city in Bosnia and Herzegovina, which is now scaling out to other places and is really enhancing citizen participation in urban planning\.

## [[0:40]] That's great\. Could you tell me a little bit about your R&D journey? Where did it all start?

[[tools:Increasing community engagement through community-growing incentives]]
[[principles:Human centering and adaptability: Less of me, more of them]]
[[principles:Recognize local expertise: Nothing for us, without us]]
[[tools:Headlines from the Future]]
It started with a request by a local government to help them kind of bring more democracy and more participation into urban planning\. Our democracy is quite young and urban planning and spatial planning is done in a certain way for a several decades\. That brings a lot of tensions in the public space\. There is a lot of spatial conflict, I would say, and we wanted to develop a methodology to bring people's voices more into account when public space is concerned, When the redesign of public space is concerned\.

## [[1:25]] Wow, that's amazing\. So what type of tools slash methods did you use to actually achieve this?

[[tools:Collaborative design of actions]]
[[principles:Inclusivity]]
[[tools:Innovative approach - Design Thinking - Issue Mapping - Stakeholder Mapping]]
[[tools:Co-Creation and Validation of Improvement Interventions]]
It was a combination of methods\. We first mapped a range of issues around the public spaces and urban planning in this particular municipality also developed a like a collective intelligence platform, a digital platform where people who could not participate in physical orbital labs, as we call them, could share their ideas about the spaces that we were treating\. There was a lot of visualization and a lot of very simple depiction of the space, so people could propose intervention in this space and reimagine the functions of public space in a very easy way\. I think this this was the best tactic that we could use, just really simplifying the whole architectural design process for anybody to participate in\.

## [[2:29]] No, that's really amazing\. So you adapted and developed those tools towards this specific use there\. That's really great\. I'll ask what skills would you say were essential for you on that journey?

[[skills:Creativity, organisation, open mind]]
[[skills:Collective intelligence, video, visibility was key success, "press advisor"]]
[[principles:Inclusivity]]
[[skills:Sharing Knowledge, training, and unusual partnership]]
Well, two types of skills I would say\. First, we needed to develop the methodology from scratch\. So our Urban Lab methodology of how to bring in public into the public space and discuss about the functions of this public space had to be developed from scratch\. So, we used a lot of innovation methods there, Co creation, citizen design, citizen participation, just to come up with a methodology that will be successful tomorrow\. And then once we started implementing this methodology, which meant combining digital data with physical workshops, actually with citizens, a lot of facilitation skills were needed, but also a lot of humbleness, I would say, because we heard many things that we didn't expect to hear and then had to use this information in a constructive way that was very challenging and was done for the first time\.

## [[3:37]] OK, OK\. So did you have to pivot or change course or try any new tactics or how did you actually be able to overcome that?

[[principles:Human centering and adaptability: Less of me, more of them]]
[[principles:Recognize local expertise: Nothing for us, without us]]
[[tactics:Understanding the Community]]
[[tools:Collaborative design of actions]]
Yes\. Initially we had one set of micro locations to work on and to kind of ask the citizens to transform over time some of these micro locations that were preset by the local government proved not to be the perfect examples and couldn't be really discussed with the citizens because of so many conflicting interests around them\. So yes, we had to both kind of still work with these difficult locations and find new ones that could be more susceptible to citizens engagement\.

## [[4:23]] Wow\. So you were basically that bridge between the work of the government as well as the community\. It's really amazing\. Now what would you say is the actual development issue that you were addressing? And then what was the situation before?

[[tools:Citizen Science and gamification using digital platform to crowdsource solutions]]
[[skills:Collective intelligence, video, visibility was key success, "press advisor"]]
[[skills:Sharing and disseminating knowledge and storytelling working in unusual thematic areas]]
[[tools:Collaborative design of actions]]
Like there were several ones that we were trying to tackle\. First was digital literacy of the population and trying to improve citizen participation overall through different means\. So both by using digital tools and by using participatory methods in person that was that was I think the key 10\.

## [[5:06]] That's great\. And then what opportunities did you see? How did you come to see them?

[[tools:Increasing community engagement through community-growing incentives]]
[[skills:Collective intelligence, video, visibility was key success, "press advisor"]]
[[tools:Headlines from the Future]]
[[principles:Recognize and promote agency: Enable agency, the greatest choice for the greatest number]]
The opportunities came about very prominently when media started paying attention\. So because this was a very pioneering work in our national setting, nobody believed it could work because people don't really like, for example, the election\. People don't go out to vote because they are not used to steal, you know, this democracy, participation in democracy\. But then slowly, really, when they saw that their voices were heard, our urban lab started to be more and more visited, and more and more people started contributed to the contributing to the digital platform as well\. And then when the media picked up on the story and started reporting about these little happenings, we knew that there was something happening, something good happening\.

## [[6:07]] Oh, well, now you know of course with sustainable development goals coming, you know in 2030, I want to ask how do you feel your work impacts towards those sustainable development goals?

[[tools:Scaling partnerships by demonstrating value incrementally]]
[[principles:Recognize local expertise: Nothing for us, without us]]
[[principles:Inclusivity]]
[[tools:Co- created Environmental Citizen Science Solutions Mapping of national initiatives]]
I think it impacts it in several ways\. It's still on the pilot phase\. So only one other city actually expressed interest to kind of try test out our methodology because it's very new\. But I think all the SDGS that concern cities and partnerships can be very well achieved by this, by this approach\.

## [[6:48]] Oh, that's great\. Now I want to ask about critical moments in your journey and then also about what do you feel catalyzed this process of yours\.

[[principles:Transparency]]
[[principles:Never deplete social capital, always increase social capital]]
[[principles:Recognize and promote agency: Enable agency, the greatest choice for the greatest number]]
[[principles:Transparency and Honesty: Be open, transparent, honest]]
First of all, I will tell you about catalyzation\. The entire process of reimagining public spaces, wouldn't be possible without strong government ownership\. So if the government didn't really recognize the need to change their ways of urban planning and to invite citizenry to participate more actively in it, it wouldn't have been possible\. So the Catalyzer actually wasn't us as the lab or as UNDP, but the a very willing local government that was ready and open for innovation\.

## [[7:33]] OK\. Now I want to ask about diffusion\. How did it diffuse towards maybe policy or say as a portfolio maybe within the UNDP country office or just the general ecosystem?

[[tools:Collaborative design of actions]]
[[principles:Inclusivity]]
[[principles:Human centering and adaptability: Less of me, more of them]]
[[principles:Recognize local expertise: Nothing for us, without us]]
Yes, well, diffusion happened in several ways\. The very methodology and the approach and the principle of the urban labs was now picked up by a different city in the country\. So we were asked to help them develop an entire area of city from scratch, again with the citizens through applying our methodology\. That's in practical terms, but also I think the visibility and like grassroots nature of this experimentation was picked up by international counterparts\. So our work was featured in different architectural magazines, gatherings of urban planners, etcetera, as an example of good practice in these terms\. It's also now becoming part of our large, new large local governance 2\.0 portfolio\.

## [[8:35]] Oh, that's really amazing and it's really impactful\. So I just want to ask from learnings if there's anything that you would do differently, say, if you had to start again, I would know rules and procedures much better in the beginning because that happens a lot\.

[[principles:Recognize and promote agency: Enable agency, the greatest choice for the greatest number]]
[[tools:Participatory Future Thinking]]
[[principles:Recognize local expertise: Nothing for us, without us]]
[[skills:Volunteering and taking initiatives]]
You have a lot of enthusiasm and you work a lot over\. It's a certain goal and that goal suddenly is impossible to read because there is an administrative barrier happening\. So to kind of prevent all of these barriers suddenly popping out in, you know, while your journey is happening, I would just be very well prepared for all sorts of administrative hurdles\.

## [[9:19]] Oh wow\. And then just finally, I want to ask, are there any assumptions that you initially went into that were maybe proven wrong then? At what point did you find out?

[[tools:Co-Creation and Validation of Improvement Interventions]]
[[tools:From Insights to Impact:  Storytelling for Renewable Energy Solutions]]
[[tools:Innovative approach - Design Thinking - Issue Mapping - Stakeholder Mapping]]
I will tell you a little story\. Within this story we reimagined or rebuilt an outside area of high school for young people with disabilities and we applied the methodology with them\. Pretty much nobody in in the ecosystem thought it would be possible because it's a very specific audience, right\. And it's a rather complex way to reimagine your outside space and kind of put it into words and pictures and, you know, hand it out the government to do something with it\. The assumption was that they couldn't do it\. The result was the best pilot we ever had because we worked with them, their teachers, their parents and the elderly who live nearby to create the first urban garden and the sensory park for people with disabilities and elderly because their needs sometimes meet in the same point\. And that was one of the most prominent, the best pilots that we did along this journey\.

## [[10:33]] That's really amazing\. So I want to thank you for your time\.
