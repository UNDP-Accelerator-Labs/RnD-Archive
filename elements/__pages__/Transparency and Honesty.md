- Embrace the culture of transparency.  
  
- Apply the “do no harm principle” all the time by being honest.  
  
- Mozambique experience with collective intelligence excercise, they were very open, honest by telling the authority (district administrator) that community was going to have a role as co-researchers  
  
- Simplify the language; distinguish between “socialization” of an intervention from real understanding and consent. Simplification is not omission of important information, it is communicating in non-technical language and creating a common and collective narrative of what´s happening and what´s going to happen.  
  
- Be honest to handle expectations.
