# Focus to creating a precedent

## Overview
Focus to creating a precedent is a tactic used in public and social innovation work to establish a new standard or model that can be replicated elsewhere.

## Purpose
The purpose of this tactic is to create a tangible example of an innovative solution, policy, or program that can serve as a reference point for others to follow. By doing so, it aims to influence decision-making, shape public opinion, and drive systemic change.

## How it works
This tactic involves designing and implementing a pilot project, initiative, or program that showcases the desired outcome or approach. The goal is to create a successful proof-of-concept that can be scaled up, adapted, or replicated in other contexts.

## Requirements
To effectively use focus to creating a precedent as a tactic, one needs:

* A clear understanding of the problem or opportunity being addressed
* A well-designed and feasible solution or approach
* Strong communication and storytelling skills to convey the value and impact of the initiative
* A willingness to iterate and adapt based on feedback and results

## Reflections
This tactic requires careful consideration of the following factors:

* Ensuring that the precedent is not just a one-off success, but rather a scalable and replicable solution
* Addressing potential barriers or challenges to adoption by others
* Building a strong network of supporters and champions who can help amplify the initiative's impact

## Related methods (if any)
This tactic is often used in conjunction with other social innovation tactics, such as co-creation, design thinking, and systems mapping.

## License
No specific license is required for this tactic. However, it is essential to ensure that any intellectual property or knowledge generated through the initiative is shared openly and collaboratively.

## Examples
Examples of focus to creating a precedent in action include:

* A city implementing a successful bike-sharing program and encouraging other cities to adopt similar initiatives
* A non-profit organization developing an innovative approach to addressing homelessness and sharing its model with other organizations
* A government agency launching a pilot project for digital identity verification and showcasing its effectiveness as a scalable solution.
