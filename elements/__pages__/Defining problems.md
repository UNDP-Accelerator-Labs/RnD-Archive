# Defining problems

## Overview
The ability to define problems is a crucial skill in public and social innovation, enabling individuals to identify the root causes of complex issues and articulate them clearly.

## Purpose
The purpose of defining problems is to clarify the underlying causes of a challenge or issue, allowing for more effective problem-solving and solution development.

## How it works
Defining problems involves analyzing the situation, identifying key stakeholders and their perspectives, and using tools such as root cause analysis or problem mapping to understand the complexities of the issue. This process helps to distinguish between symptoms and underlying causes, ensuring that solutions address the heart of the problem rather than just its surface-level manifestations.

## Requirements
Effective problem definition requires a combination of critical thinking, empathy, and analytical skills. It also involves being open-minded, willing to challenge assumptions, and able to navigate complex systems and power dynamics.

## Reflections
Defining problems is an iterative process that often requires revisiting initial assumptions and adjusting the approach as new information becomes available. It's essential to remain flexible and adapt to changing circumstances while maintaining a clear focus on the underlying issue.
