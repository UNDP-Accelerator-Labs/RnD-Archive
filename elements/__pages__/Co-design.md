# Co-design

## Overview
Co-design is a collaborative approach where stakeholders, including community members, work together with designers and innovators to co-create solutions.

## Purpose
The purpose of co-design is to ensure that the needs and perspectives of all stakeholders are taken into account in the design process, resulting in more effective and sustainable solutions.

## How it works
Co-design involves a participatory process where community members are actively engaged in the design and development of solutions. This can include workshops, interviews, and other forms of collaboration to ensure that the needs and perspectives of all stakeholders are considered.

## Requirements
Effective co-design requires a willingness to collaborate and share power among stakeholders. It also requires a facilitative approach to guide the process and ensure that all voices are heard.

## Reflections
Co-design can be time-consuming and requires significant resources, but it can lead to more effective and sustainable solutions in the long run.

## Related methods (if any)
Co-design is often used in conjunction with other social innovation tactics such as participatory budgeting and community-led planning.

## License
No specific license is required for co-design, but it is essential to ensure that all stakeholders have a clear understanding of their roles and responsibilities throughout the process.

## Examples
Examples of successful co-design initiatives include community-led urban planning projects and participatory design of social services.
