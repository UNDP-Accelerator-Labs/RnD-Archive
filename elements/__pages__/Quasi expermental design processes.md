# Quasi experimental design processes

## Overview
Quasi-experimental design processes are studies that evaluate interventions without using randomization, aiming to demonstrate causality between an intervention and its outcome.

## Purpose
This method helps evaluate interventions during field tests, generating evidence on their impacts. It provides a way to prove a concept before conducting fully randomized evaluations.

## How it works
Quasi-experiments involve comparing the effects of an intervention with those of a control group or baseline data. Pre- and post-intervention data is collected, analyzed, and presented to understand the intervention's impact.

## Requirements
A solution addressing a community-identified challenge, an independent evaluator (if necessary), data analysis skills, and storytelling skills to present results are required for effective use of this method.

## Reflections
No inference can be derived from quasi-experimental design processes due to their non-randomized nature.
