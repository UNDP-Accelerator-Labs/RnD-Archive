## Description: What is it? (max 1,500 characters)



A service blueprint tool helps us visualize the entire service process, including interactions between users and service providers, as well as behind-the-scenes activities and systems. It's a tool that can help us better understand and improve service delivery by highlighting touchpoints, roles, processes, and (inter)dependencies.

## Purpose: Why do we use this method or tool for R&amp;D? (max 1,500 characters)



During the exploratory phase, we use a service blueprint in R&amp;D to gain a comprehensive understanding of the service delivery process, identify inefficiencies and pain points, and uncover opportunities for innovation and improvement in both user-facing and behind-the-scenes operations. In the prototyping phase, we use the tool to validate a the designed system, intervention, or model with stakeholders.

## Summary: Describe in one sentence, what it is and what it does? (max 120 characters)



A service blueprint is a visual diagram for detailing and analyzing the service delivery process to identify areas for improvement and ensure a seamless user experience.

## Instructions: How is it used for R&amp;D? What steps to follow?



To successfully use a service blueprint tool, (1) identify key service(s) to be mapped, (2) establish goals of the blueprint, such as identifying inefficiencies or addressing user experience, (3) document steps taken by users throughout the service experience, (4) identify and pinpoint all interactions between the end user and the service provider, including physical and digital touchpoints, (5) categorize the activities into "frontstage" for visible/direct activities and "backstage" for behind-the-scenes/non-visible activities, (6) identify supporting processes and systems that enable those activities, (7) identify and analyze painpoints and opportunities such as friction areas and inefficiencies, (8) review with stakeholders to validate, gather feedback, and/or iterate, (9) use insights to guide R&amp;D efforts in refining services for efficiency and user satisfaction.

## Requirements: What is needed to effectively use it for R&amp;D? (e.g. skills, conditions, inputs, resources)



Effectively using user journey mapping requires solid analytical skills, facilitation skills, access to users and stakeholders to gather data, deep understanding of user insight, ability to engage diverse stakeholders, and a service blueprint template (or digital equivalent).
