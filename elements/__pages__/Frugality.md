# Frugality

## Overview
Frugality is a key principle in public and social innovation, emphasizing the efficient use of resources to achieve maximum impact.

## Purpose
The purpose of frugality is to ensure that experiments and initiatives are designed to be cost-effective, minimizing waste and maximizing value for money.

## How it works
In practice, frugality involves being mindful of resource allocation, seeking low-cost solutions, and avoiding unnecessary expenses. This principle encourages innovators to think creatively about how to achieve their goals with minimal resources.

## Requirements
To apply the principle of frugality, innovators should be willing to challenge conventional approaches, question assumptions, and explore alternative methods that are more cost-effective.

## Reflections
Implementing frugality requires a mindset shift from traditional thinking, where more often than not, more resources are seen as better. By adopting frugality, innovators can demonstrate their commitment to responsible resource management and accountability.
