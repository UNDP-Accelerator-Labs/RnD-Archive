# Disruptiveness

## Overview
Disruptiveness is a principle in public and social innovation that refers to the ability of an intervention or solution to change the usual way of doing things, bringing about transformative outcomes.

## Purpose
The purpose of disruptiveness is to provide solutions that challenge existing norms, systems, and power dynamics, leading to significant positive changes in society.

## How it works
Disruptive interventions often involve challenging conventional wisdom, experimenting with new approaches, and taking calculated risks. They aim to create a "game-changer" effect by addressing deep-seated problems or unmet needs in innovative ways.

## Requirements
To be considered disruptive, an intervention should have the potential to significantly alter existing systems, policies, or practices. It should also demonstrate a willingness to challenge conventional thinking and take calculated risks.

## Reflections
Disruptiveness requires a mindset shift among stakeholders, including policymakers, practitioners, and community members. It demands a willingness to experiment, adapt, and learn from failures.

## Related methods (if any)
Design Thinking, Co-creation, and Systems Mapping are related methods that can help foster disruptiveness in public and social innovation.

## License
This principle is often used under an open-source or collaborative license, allowing for the sharing of knowledge, expertise, and resources to drive collective impact.

## Examples
Examples of disruptive interventions include the development of new technologies (e.g., mobile payments), innovative service delivery models (e.g., community-based healthcare), and policy reforms that challenge existing power dynamics.
