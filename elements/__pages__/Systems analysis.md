## Description: What is it? (max 1,500 characters)



Systems mapping is a  
process of identifying, listing and graphically representing key stakeholders  
and initiatives of a target area and system. Systems mapping can be implemented  
in layers, including (1) community initiatives (e.g.: a local reading awareness  
campaign); (2) small and medium scale actions (e.g.: rural entrepreneurship  
support actions); (3) large scale actions (training centers); and (4)  
regulatory opportunities (new food regulations).

## Purpose: Why do we use this method or tool for R&amp;D? (max 1,500 characters)



Systems mapping  
visualizes various initiatives and their interconnections between initiatives  
and stakeholders within one single frame. This lays the foundation for  
understanding people’s narratives and developing people-centric portfolios.

## Summary: Describe in one sentence, what it is and what it does? (max 120 characters)



Systems mapping is a sense making method  
for identifying, listing and graphically representing key stakeholders and  
initiatives of a target area and system

## Instructions: How is it used for R&amp;D? What steps to follow?



STEP 1: Map all  
actors and initiatives in the area you are working in.  
  
STEP 2: Develop a  
list of key stakeholders and actors.  
  
STEP 3: Classify key  
stakeholders according to name, sector, thematic area and contact  
  
STEP 4: Assign all  
existing initiatives to relevant level of intervention (community, small &amp;  
medium, large-scale, regulatory)  
  
STEP 5: Sensemaking.  
Present, review, and validate map with relevant stakeholders.

## Requirements: What is needed to effectively use it for R&amp;D? (e.g. skills, conditions, inputs, resources)



This tool requires extended time for scanning existing initiatives and actors within a system, and  
will also demand basic digital literacy skills for conducting an in-depth  
search on the system in question. Online applications such as kumu assist in  
the visualization process of systems mapping.
