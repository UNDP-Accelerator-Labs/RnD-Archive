# How might we (hmw)

## Overview
How Might We (HMW) is a design thinking method that reframes problem statements into open-ended questions to inspire innovative thinking and ideation.

## Purpose
To stimulate creative thinking, encourage ideation, and generate a broad range of solutions by focusing on user needs and challenges.

## How it works
Start with a clear understanding of the problem or challenge. Reframe the problem as an open-ended question starting with "How Might We...". Encourage brainstorming and ideation, focusing on generating a wide range of solutions.

## Requirements
Effective use requires a collaborative mindset, an understanding of the problem space, and a willingness to explore diverse solutions. Sharpies and Post-its are commonly used for brainstorming sessions.

## Reflections
Keep an open mind and avoid jumping to solutions too quickly. Focus on the user's perspective and ensure that the HMW questions are neither too broad nor too narrow.
