## Description: What is it? (max 1,500 characters)



How Might We (HMW) is a design thinking method that reframes problem statements into open-ended questions to inspire innovative thinking and ideation. It encourages looking at challenges from different perspectives, fostering creativity and collaborative problem-solving.

## Purpose: Why do we use this method or tool for R&amp;D? (max 1,500 characters)



HMW is used in R&amp;D to stimulate creative thinking, encourage ideation, and generate a broad range of solutions. It helps teams to focus on user needs and challenges, promoting empathy and a user-centered approach in developing innovative solutions.

## Summary: Describe in one sentence, what it is and what it does? (max 120 characters)



A method that reframes problems into questions for innovative solutions.

## Instructions: How is it used for R&amp;D? What steps to follow?



Start with a clear understanding of the problem or challenge.  
Reframe the problem as an open-ended question starting with "How Might We..."  
Encourage brainstorming and ideation, focusing on generating a wide range of solutions.  
Evaluate and prioritize the ideas generated for further development and testing.

## Requirements: What is needed to effectively use it for R&amp;D? (e.g. skills, conditions, inputs, resources)



Effective use requires a collaborative mindset, an understanding of the problem space, and a willingness to explore diverse solutions. Sharpies and Post-its are commonly used for brainstorming sessions.

## Reflections: What to keep in mind when using the tool for R&amp;D purposes?



Keep an open mind and avoid jumping to solutions too quickly. Focus on the user's perspective and ensure that the HMW questions are neither too broad nor too narrow.
