# Overcoming resistance

## Overview
Overcoming resistance is a key challenge in public and social innovation work, where stakeholders may be hesitant to adopt new ideas or approaches.

## Purpose
The purpose of overcoming resistance is to address obstacles and challenges that hinder the implementation of innovative solutions, ensuring their successful adoption and impact.

## How it works
This tactic involves meeting people where they are, rather than trying to change them. It requires a flexible approach, such as using a "pivoting fluid agenda" to adapt to changing circumstances and priorities. This allows for more effective engagement with stakeholders and better navigation of complex issues.

## Requirements
To overcome resistance effectively, one needs to be able to de-jargon (simplify complex language), persuade others to care about the issue, negotiate competing priorities, and work with people where they are, rather than trying to change them.

## Reflections
Overcoming resistance requires a deep understanding of the stakeholders' concerns, needs, and values. It also demands a willingness to adapt and be flexible in approach.
