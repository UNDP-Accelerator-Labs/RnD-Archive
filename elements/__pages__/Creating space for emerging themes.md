# Creating space for emerging themes

## Overview
Creating space for emerging themes is a tactic used in public and social innovation work to identify and nurture new ideas, initiatives, or areas of focus that have the potential to drive positive change.

## Purpose
The purpose of this tactic is to create an environment where emerging themes can be explored, tested, and developed without being constrained by existing structures, processes, or priorities.

## How it works
This tactic involves starting small, often with a pilot project or initiative, to test and validate the potential of an emerging theme. It also requires getting buy-in from key stakeholders, including counterparts and decision-makers, to establish legitimacy and support for the new idea or initiative.

## Requirements
To be successful, this tactic requires a willingness to experiment, take calculated risks, and adapt to changing circumstances. It also needs a supportive environment that allows for flexibility and innovation.

## Reflections
This tactic can help organizations stay agile and responsive to emerging trends and needs, but it may require significant effort and resources to establish credibility and momentum.

## Related methods (if any)
Starting small, getting buy-in from key stakeholders, and aligning with counterparts' priorities are related methods that can be used in conjunction with creating space for emerging themes.
