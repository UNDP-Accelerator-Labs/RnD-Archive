# Asset mapping - nothing for us, without us

## Overview
Asset mapping is a community engagement tactic that involves identifying and documenting the skills, resources, and assets present within a community.

## Purpose
The purpose of asset mapping is to empower communities by recognizing their existing strengths and capacities, thereby encouraging them to take ownership of problem-solving and solution implementation.

## How it works
This tactic typically begins with working with gatekeepers or key stakeholders in the community to gain access and trust. By mapping the assets within the community, such as skills, resources, and networks, the community is able to see its own value and potential for addressing issues at hand.

## Requirements
Effective asset mapping requires a collaborative approach, active listening, and a willingness to learn from the community. It also necessitates a shift in perspective, focusing on what the community has rather than what it lacks.

## Reflections
Asset mapping can be a powerful tool for building trust and fostering community-led innovation. However, it demands time, effort, and a genuine commitment to co-creation with the community.

## Related methods (if any)
This tactic is often used in conjunction with other community engagement strategies, such as participatory budgeting or co-design workshops.

## License
No specific license is associated with this tactic.

## Examples
Examples of asset mapping include community-led needs assessments, skill-sharing initiatives, and resource mobilization efforts.
