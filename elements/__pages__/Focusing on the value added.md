## Description: What is it? (max 1,500 characters)



AccLab South Africa met with the Dept of Science and Innovation (DSI) in 2019, where its value was questioned given that the SA innovation ecosystem was well established (yet not functioning at 100%).  
  
  
AccLab South Africa "strong-armed" its way into working with the DSI despite resistance, and started on small projects. the Lab would fund USD 10 000 innovation challenges (sometimes being the only partner offering finances), participated in DSI's thought leadership events, conference panels, workshops, etc.  
Given the success of these small projects, DSI noted Acclab's potential, and brought together others partners to scale up towards medium sized interventions with the lab where multiple parties financed innovation challenges, hackathons, etc.,  
AccLab's value became clear, and this resulted in a USD 900K partnership with the CO, the first of its kind in the CO with this department, and one of few within the CO where government funding is involved.  
  
  
Hence start small, demonstrate value, build trust, all of which will lead to partnerships growing incrementally.

## Purpose: Why do we use this method or tool for R&amp;D? (max 1,500 characters)



To scale projects to reach more beneficiaries and make greater impact on people and planet.

## Summary: Describe in one sentence, what it is and what it does? (max 120 characters)



This is a method of scaling partnerships, as one would scale a product/service. For a product, you start with a minimum viable product, garner success and clients, and grow your offering.  
  
  
This method applies to partnerships too, where you demonstrate partnership value slowly, but surely towards and end goal of scaling the programme/projects you work on.

## Instructions: How is it used for R&amp;D? What steps to follow?



It is used to gather more support for R&amp;D programmes , by growing partnerships with those who have similar goals, values, missions and visions. Without partnerships, R&amp;D acheives little to no impact on society.

## Requirements: What is needed to effectively use it for R&amp;D? (e.g. skills, conditions, inputs, resources)



Training on partnership and stakeholder managament  
emotional intelligence  
technical know-how
