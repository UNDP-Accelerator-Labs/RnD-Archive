# Critical thinking

## Overview
Critical thinking is the ability to objectively analyze information, evaluate evidence, and form well-supported conclusions.

## Purpose
The purpose of critical thinking in public and social innovation work is to ensure that solutions are informed by accurate and unbiased analysis, rather than assumptions or intuition.

## How it works
Critical thinking involves breaking down complex problems into manageable parts, identifying biases and assumptions, and considering multiple perspectives. It also requires the ability to distinguish between relevant and irrelevant information, as well as to recognize when evidence is lacking or incomplete.

## Requirements
Effective critical thinking requires a combination of cognitive skills, such as analysis, evaluation, and synthesis, as well as emotional intelligence, including self-awareness, empathy, and open-mindedness.

## Reflections
Developing critical thinking skills takes time and practice. It involves being willing to challenge one's own assumptions and biases, as well as those of others.

## Related methods (if any)
Critical thinking is closely related to other skills such as problem-solving, decision-making, and evidence-based policy-making.
