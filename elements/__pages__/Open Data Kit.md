## Overview
ODK (Open Data Kit) is a powerful open-source software platform used for data collection in research and development.

## Purpose
The purpose of ODK is to empower researchers, field teams, and other professionals to collect data efficiently, both online and offline, during research and monitoring activities.

## How it works
ODK allows users to build forms using the XLSForm standard in tools like Excel or Google Sheets. These forms can be uploaded to an ODK Central server, downloaded into the ODK Collect app on an Android device, and used for data collection. Collected data is then synced with the ODK Central server when an internet connection is available.

## Requirements
To effectively use ODK, users need to have basic computer skills, access to a Google Drive space, and gadgets such as tablets that data collectors can use while conducting surveys. Additionally, users should be aware of potential issues like GPS coordinate accuracy and multiple enumerators using the same forms.

## Reflections
When using ODK for R&D purposes, it's essential to keep in mind the limitations mentioned above, including GPS coordinate accuracy and the need for multiple indicators to verify data collector identity.

## Related methods (if any)
ODK is commonly used with data collection methods.

## License
ODK is available under a free or open-source license.

## Examples
Examples of organizations using ODK include the World Health Organization (WHO), Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT), and Bangor University.
