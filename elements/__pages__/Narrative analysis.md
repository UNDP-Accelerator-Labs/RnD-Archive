# Narrative analysis

## Overview
Narrative analysis is a sense-making method used in public and social innovation work to identify, categorize, and understand subjective perceptions of individuals or communities.

## Purpose
The purpose of narrative analysis is to gather in-depth insights into local realities and willingness to change by differentiating between surface narratives, hidden narratives, and metanarratives.

## How it works
Narrative analysis involves extracting quotes from deep listening/consultation exercises, classifying them based on similarity, difference, frequency, correspondence, sequence, and causality, and analyzing the underlying convictions that drive systemic transformations.

## Requirements
To effectively use narrative analysis, a pre-implemented deep listening/consultative session is required, along with recordings and transcripts of these sessions.

## Reflections
Narrative analysis requires careful consideration of the context in which it is used to ensure accurate representation of local realities.

## Related methods (if any)
Narrative analysis is often used in conjunction with visual thinking and mapping techniques.

## License
Narrative analysis is a free or open tool, available for public use without restrictions.

## Examples
The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) has used narrative analysis in their work, as seen in the example of Mongolia's Zavkhan Province tackling complexity through a portfolio approach.
