# Flexibility, adaptability

## Overview
Flexibility and adaptability are essential principles in public and social innovation work, allowing experiments to be agile and responsive to changing circumstances.

## Purpose
The purpose of flexibility and adaptability is to enable incremental learning, continuous feedback, and iteration, making experiments more resilient and effective.

## How it works
This principle involves striking a balance between structure and agility. While experiments should have clear goals and agendas, they should also be open to adapting as needed in response to new information or changing circumstances.

## Requirements
There are no specific requirements for implementing flexibility and adaptability, but it is essential to maintain a flexible mindset and be willing to adjust plans accordingly.

## Reflections
Flexibility and adaptability require a high degree of self-awareness, emotional intelligence, and effective communication skills. They also involve being open to feedback and willing to learn from mistakes.

## Related methods (if any)
This principle is closely related to the design thinking methodology, which emphasizes empathy, creativity, and experimentation in solving complex problems.

## License
No specific license or permission is required for implementing flexibility and adaptability.

## Examples
Examples of experiments that embody flexibility and adaptability include participatory budgeting processes, co-creation workshops, and iterative prototyping exercises.
