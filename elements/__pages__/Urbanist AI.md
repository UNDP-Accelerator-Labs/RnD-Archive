## Description: What is it? (max 1,500 characters)

The tool is a generative AI platform for participatory planning and co-design of urban places that integrates multiple generative AI technologies.  It can enable the public sector to lead the codesign process of their cities.

## Purpose: Why do we use this method or tool for R&amp;D? (max 1,500 characters)

The GenAI for image processing can have multiple benefits when used with citizen scientiests such as:  
1. Harnessing the power of collective intelligence to reimagine the future of our cities.  
2. Shifting stakeholders role from commentators to pacemakers  
3. Democratize urban change in a fun way. It has even a scratch and child-friendly version  
  
  
  
  
All combined, visual communication is the most powerful way for a group of stakeholders to have an impact and bring their visions forward in their organisations.

## Summary: Describe in one sentence, what it is and what it does? (max 120 characters)

The tool is a generative AI platform for participatory planning and co-design of urban places that integrates multiple generative AI technologies.

## Instructions: How is it used for R&amp;D? What steps to follow?

In our scenario, participants were first divided into groups based on pictures of places that they wanted to see changed. Participants applied Urbanist AI’s picture generation software to image and co-design the place.  
Throughout these sessions, Urbanist AI emerged not only as a tool, but also as a mode for getting people together. Attendees enjoyed engaging in the exercises and had positive learning experiences, which we hope will magnify the impact of UNDP’s participatory design workshops. As we fine-tune our approach, our next step is figuring out how to extend the benefits of platforms like Urbanist AI beyond collaborative co-creation exercises to synergize other aspects of the portfolio process. Additionally, we’re exploring potential partnerships that could be unlocked through innovative applications of such platforms.

## Requirements: What is needed to effectively use it for R&amp;D? (e.g. skills, conditions, inputs, resources)

There are no general pre-requirements for using UrbanistAI. It is recommended that the facilitator of the session gets acquainted with the tool before commencing the workshop. Before the workshop, colleagues from Urbanist AI spent some time with our team to explain how the tool works and how we can organize the workshop itself to utilize the tool to the maximum.  
  
The Urbanist AI tool seems to be something that the participants in our workshop liked, liked to play with it, and saw value in the tool and the workshop. Our workshop lasted half a day, and we worked on several spaces that we were redesigning in groups;

## Reflections: What to keep in mind when using the tool for R&amp;D purposes?

The Urbanist AI tool allows for localization of the problem, so we added pictures from our capital city, which made it very useful for us to the group to discuss the issues. We went the extra mile to train the AI with local indigenous plants and trees in order to avoid getting random generated plants and trees
