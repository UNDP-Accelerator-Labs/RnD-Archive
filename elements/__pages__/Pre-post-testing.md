# Pre-post-testing

## Overview
Pre-post-testing is a method used in public and social innovation to test the effectiveness of a concept, product, or service before its full-scale implementation.

## Purpose
The purpose of pre-post-testing is to evaluate the impact of an intervention by comparing outcomes before and after its introduction, allowing for adjustments to be made before scaling up.

## How it works
This method involves collecting data on a specific outcome or metric before introducing the concept, product, or service (pre-test), and then re-collecting the same data after its implementation (post-test). The results are compared to determine if there is a significant change in the desired direction.

## Requirements
Pre-post-testing requires a clear definition of the intervention and outcomes to be measured, as well as a control group or baseline data for comparison. It also necessitates a rigorous design and data collection process to ensure validity and reliability.

## Reflections
This method can provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of an innovation, but it may not account for external factors that could influence the results. Additionally, pre-post-testing should be used in conjunction with other evaluation methods to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the intervention's impact.

## Related methods (if any)
Pre-post-testing is often used in combination with other methods such as randomized controlled trials or quasi-experimental designs.

## License
No specific license is required for using pre-post-testing, but it should be adapted and applied according to local regulations and ethical standards.

## Examples
Examples of pre-post-testing include evaluating the impact of a new public health campaign on disease prevention rates or assessing the effectiveness of a job training program in reducing unemployment.
