# Communicate through human stories

## Overview
Communicating through human stories is a tactic used in public and social innovation work to convey complex information, build empathy, and create a personal connection with stakeholders.

## Purpose
The purpose of this tactic is to use real-life examples and anecdotes to illustrate the impact and effectiveness of an initiative or project, making it more relatable and memorable for the audience.

## How it works
This tactic involves sharing stories about individuals or communities who have been affected by a social issue or benefited from a particular intervention. These stories can be presented through various formats, such as videos, podcasts, blog posts, or in-person presentations.

## Requirements
To effectively communicate through human stories, it is essential to:

* Gather authentic and compelling stories that resonate with the target audience
* Ensure that the stories are told in a respectful and sensitive manner, avoiding exploitation or sensationalism
* Use clear and concise language to convey the key messages and takeaways

## Reflections
This tactic can be particularly effective when used in conjunction with other methods, such as design thinking or co-creation. It allows stakeholders to connect emotionally with the issue at hand and fosters a deeper understanding of the complexities involved.
