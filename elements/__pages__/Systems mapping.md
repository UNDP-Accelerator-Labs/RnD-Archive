# System mapping

## Overview
System mapping is a sense-making method used in public and social innovation work to identify, list, and graphically represent key stakeholders and initiatives within a target area and system.

## Purpose
The purpose of system mapping is to visualize various initiatives and their interconnections between initiatives and stakeholders within one single frame, laying the foundation for understanding people's narratives and developing people-centric portfolios.

## How it works
System mapping involves several steps: (1) mapping all actors and initiatives in the area being worked on, (2) developing a list of key stakeholders and actors, (3) classifying key stakeholders according to name, sector, thematic area, and contact, (4) assigning existing initiatives to relevant levels of intervention, and (5) sense-making through presenting, reviewing, and validating the map with relevant stakeholders.

## Requirements
System mapping requires extended time for scanning existing initiatives and actors within a system, as well as basic digital literacy skills for conducting an in-depth search on the system. Online applications such as kumu can assist in the visualization process.

## Reflections
There are no specific reflections mentioned in the notes, but it is essential to keep in mind that system mapping demands time and resources, and its effectiveness depends on the quality of data collected and the level of stakeholder engagement.

## Related methods (if any)
System mapping is often used in conjunction with other methods such as Visual Thinking & Mapping and making.
