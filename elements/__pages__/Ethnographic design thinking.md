# Ethnographic design thinking

## Overview
Ethnographic design thinking is a research approach that combines anthropology and design principles to gain a deeper understanding of people's behaviors, needs, and cultural contexts.

## Purpose
The purpose of ethnographic design thinking is to gather rich, qualitative data on the complexities of social issues and identify innovative solutions that are tailored to specific communities or regions.

## How it works
This approach involves immersive research methods such as participant observation, interviews, and field notes to gain a nuanced understanding of people's experiences and cultural norms. Designers and researchers then use this information to co-create solutions with stakeholders.

## Requirements
Ethnographic design thinking requires a willingness to engage in long-term, iterative research processes that involve building relationships with community members and stakeholders.

## Reflections
This approach encourages reflection on one's own biases and assumptions, as well as the development of empathy and cultural competence.
