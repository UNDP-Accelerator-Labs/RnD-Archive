# Proof of concept

## Overview
Proof of concept is a tactic used in public and social innovation work to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of an idea or solution by presenting concrete examples, case studies, or pilot projects.

## Purpose
The purpose of proof of concept is to build credibility and trust with stakeholders, particularly government officials, by showing that an idea has been successfully implemented elsewhere or can be adapted to a specific context.

## How it works
This tactic involves collecting and sharing evidence of successful implementations, often from other countries or contexts, and highlighting how they can be applied locally. By doing so, it aims to alleviate concerns about the feasibility or effectiveness of an innovation.

## Requirements
To effectively use proof of concept as a tactic, one needs to have access to relevant case studies, pilot projects, or research findings that demonstrate the success of similar initiatives in other contexts.

## Reflections
While proof of concept can be a powerful tool for building credibility, it is essential to ensure that the examples used are genuinely applicable and adaptable to the local context. It's also crucial to be transparent about the limitations and potential challenges associated with implementing an innovation.

## Related methods (if any)
This tactic is often combined with other strategies such as co-creation, participatory budgeting, or policy entrepreneurship.

## License
No specific license is required for using proof of concept as a tactic. However, it's essential to ensure that the case studies and research findings used are properly cited and attributed.

## Examples
Examples of successful proof of concept implementations include sharing best practices from other countries, presenting pilot projects that demonstrate the effectiveness of an innovation, or showcasing research findings that highlight the potential benefits of an idea.
