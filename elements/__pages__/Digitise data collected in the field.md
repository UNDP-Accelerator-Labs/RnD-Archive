# Digitalize data collectedÂ  in the field

## Overview
Digitalizing data collected in the field is a tactic used in public and social innovation work to efficiently manage, analyze, and share data gathered from various sources.

## Purpose
The purpose of digitalizing data is to make it easily accessible, searchable, and usable for decision-making, monitoring, and evaluation purposes. This helps to reduce manual processing time, minimize errors, and enhance collaboration among stakeholders.

## How it works
This tactic involves using technology, such as software or apps, to convert paper-based or other non-digital data into a digital format that can be easily stored, retrieved, and analyzed. The process typically includes scanning or photographing documents, entering data into a database or spreadsheet, and organizing the data in a way that facilitates analysis.

## Requirements
To successfully implement this tactic, organizations need to have access to suitable technology, such as computers, smartphones, or tablets, as well as software or apps capable of digitizing data. Additionally, staff members must receive training on how to use these tools effectively.

## Reflections
Digitalizing data collected in the field can help improve data quality, reduce costs associated with manual processing, and enhance collaboration among stakeholders. However, it may also require significant upfront investment in technology and training.

## Related methods (if any)
This tactic is often used in conjunction with other tactics such as Data Visualization, which helps to present complex data in a clear and understandable format for decision-making purposes.

## License
No specific license is required for this tactic, but organizations must ensure that they comply with relevant data protection regulations when collecting, storing, and sharing digitalized data.

## Examples
Examples of organizations using digitalization tactics include local governments digitizing field reports from community outreach programs or NGOs using mobile apps to collect and analyze data on environmental conservation efforts.
