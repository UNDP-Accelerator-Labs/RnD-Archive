# Recognize local expertise: nothing for us, without us

## Overview
Recognize local expertise: Nothing for us, without us is a principle that emphasizes the importance of involving and valuing the knowledge and expertise of local communities in solving their own problems.

## Purpose
This principle seeks to shift the traditional approach of treating communities as beneficiaries, instead recognizing them as experts who are best positioned to understand and address their own needs.

## How it works
By adopting a bottom-up approach, this principle encourages collaboration and co-creation between external stakeholders and local communities. It involves acknowledging that those affected by problems have unique insights and knowledge that should be respected and incorporated into the problem-solving process.

## Requirements
To apply this principle effectively, individuals or organizations must be willing to surrender their own assumptions and biases, and instead create a blank canvas for co-creation and learning. This requires a willingness to listen, learn from, and be guided by local expertise.

## Reflections
Recognizing local expertise: Nothing for us, without us is not just about involving communities in the decision-making process, but also about acknowledging that failure can be an essential part of the learning process. By embracing this principle, individuals or organizations can foster a culture of humility, openness, and continuous improvement.
