# Setting up the first block of the pyramid

## Overview
Setting up the first block of the pyramid is a tactic used in public and social innovation work.

## Purpose
The purpose of this tactic is to introduce a new initiative or project by building on existing momentum, often by leveraging resistance or opposition as a catalyst for change.

## How it works
This tactic involves identifying areas where there is resistance or opposition, and using these points as the foundation for introducing a new work line or initiative. By doing so, innovators can build on existing energy and create a sense of urgency around their proposal.

## Requirements
To successfully implement this tactic, innovators need to have a good understanding of the organizational dynamics and be able to identify areas where resistance is likely to occur. They also need to be skilled at navigating complex power structures and building coalitions.

## Reflections
This tactic requires a deep understanding of the organization's culture and politics, as well as the ability to think strategically and build on existing momentum. It can be a high-risk approach, but it can also yield significant rewards if executed successfully.
