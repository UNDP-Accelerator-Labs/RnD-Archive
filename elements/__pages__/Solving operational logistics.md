# Solving operational logistic

## Overview
Solving Operational Logistics is a tactic used in public and social innovation work to address operational challenges and optimize resource allocation.

## Purpose
The purpose of this tactic is to identify and resolve operational inefficiencies, freeing up resources for more strategic and impactful activities.

## How it works
This tactic involves recruiting United Nations Volunteers (UNVs) or other external support to assist with multiple tasks, thereby reducing the workload of internal staff and improving overall efficiency.

## Requirements
To implement Solving Operational Logistics effectively, organizations need to have a clear understanding of their operational needs and be able to identify areas where external support can make a significant impact. They must also establish effective communication channels with UNVs or other external partners.

## Reflections
