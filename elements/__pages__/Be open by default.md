# Open data

## Overview
Open data is the practice of making data publicly available and accessible, often in digital formats.

## Purpose
The purpose of open data is to promote transparency, accountability, and collaboration by providing access to information that can be used to inform decision-making, monitor progress, and evaluate outcomes.

## How it works
Open data involves digitizing solutions and making the resulting data available to others. This can include sharing data on project outcomes, participant engagement, or other relevant metrics.

## Requirements
To implement open data effectively, organizations should ensure that they have a clear plan for collecting, storing, and disseminating data in an accessible format.

## Reflections
Open data requires a culture of transparency and honesty, where stakeholders are willing to share information and be accountable for their actions. This can involve simplifying language and creating a common narrative around project goals and outcomes.

## Related methods (if any)
Transparency and Honesty is related to open data as it emphasizes the importance of being open and honest in sharing data and information with others.

## License
No specific license is required for open data, but organizations should ensure that they have the necessary permissions and agreements in place to share data with others.

## Examples
Examples of open data in practice include the Mozambique collective intelligence exercise, where community members were involved as co-researchers and had access to project data.
