# Persuasion

## Overview
Persuasion is a tactic used in public and social innovation work to influence decision-makers or stakeholders by highlighting the contradictions behind their resistance or reluctance.

## Purpose
The purpose of persuasion is to overcome obstacles, build support, and create momentum for an initiative or project by addressing the underlying concerns and interests of key stakeholders.

## How it works
Persuasion involves identifying the root causes of resistance or reluctance and presenting a clear and compelling argument that highlights the contradictions between the stakeholder's stated goals and their current actions. This can be done through effective communication, storytelling, and framing of the issue to resonate with the stakeholder's values and interests.

## Requirements
Effective persuasion requires a deep understanding of the stakeholder's needs, concerns, and motivations, as well as strong communication and interpersonal skills. It also requires a clear and compelling message that is tailored to the specific context and audience.

## Reflections
Persuasion can be an effective tactic when used in conjunction with other approaches, such as co-creation or collaborative problem-solving. However, it may not always be successful, particularly if the underlying issues are deeply entrenched or if there are significant power imbalances between stakeholders.
