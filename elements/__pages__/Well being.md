# Well being

## Overview
Well-being is a principle that prioritizes the care and well-being of individuals, teams, and communities in public and social innovation work.

## Purpose
Prioritizing well-being is essential because it recognizes that people's capacity to participate, contribute, and thrive is directly linked to their overall well-being. By focusing on well-being, organizations can create a positive and supportive environment that fosters collaboration, creativity, and effective problem-solving.

## How it works
Implementing the principle of well-being involves actively promoting and supporting the physical, emotional, and mental health of individuals and teams. This can be achieved through various strategies, such as providing resources for stress management, encouraging work-life balance, and fostering a culture of empathy and understanding.

## Requirements
To effectively prioritize well-being, organizations should:

* Recognize the importance of well-being in achieving social innovation goals
* Provide resources and support for maintaining physical, emotional, and mental health
* Foster a culture that values self-care and team care
* Encourage open communication and feedback

## Reflections
Prioritizing well-being can have numerous benefits, including improved job satisfaction, increased productivity, and enhanced creativity. However, it also requires a shift in organizational culture and mindset, which can be challenging to implement.

## Related methods (if any)
This principle is closely related to the concept of "co-creation" and "participatory approaches," as well-being is often seen as a key factor in effective co-creation and participation.

This principle is not proprietary and can be adapted by any organization or individual working in public and social innovation.
