# It's not personal. don't take no for an answer

## Overview
A principle in public and social innovation that emphasizes the importance of separating one's personal feelings from the pursuit of goals, particularly when dealing with rejection or setbacks.

## Purpose
This principle is essential to maintain objectivity and persistence in the face of obstacles, ensuring that efforts are not derailed by emotional reactions.

## How it works
When faced with a "no" or a setback, this principle encourages individuals to remain detached from their emotions and continue pushing forward, rather than taking the rejection personally.

## Requirements
Effective application of this principle requires self-awareness, emotional regulation, and a clear understanding of one's goals and motivations.

## Reflections
This principle can be challenging to implement, as it involves setting aside personal feelings and biases. However, doing so can lead to greater resilience, adaptability, and ultimately, success in achieving desired outcomes.

## Related methods (if any)
This principle is often used in conjunction with the "Design Thinking" approach, which emphasizes empathy, experimentation, and iteration to develop innovative solutions.
