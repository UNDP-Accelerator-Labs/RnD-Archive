# Simulation, role play, games

## Overview
Simulation, role play, and games are interactive methods used to engage stakeholders in immersive experiences that mimic real-world scenarios or hypothetical situations.

## Purpose
The purpose of simulation, role play, and games is to facilitate learning, experimentation, and decision-making in a safe and controlled environment. They aim to increase empathy, understanding, and collaboration among participants by simulating complex issues or challenges.

## How it works
These methods involve creating a simulated environment where participants take on roles or personas, often with specific objectives or constraints. The simulation can be facilitated by a moderator or game master, who guides the process and ensures that the experience stays on track. Participants may engage in discussions, make decisions, or take actions within the simulated environment.

## Requirements
To implement simulation, role play, and games effectively, several requirements must be met:

* A clear understanding of the issue or challenge being addressed
* A well-designed scenario or game plan
* Engaged and motivated participants
* A facilitator or moderator with experience in running simulations and games

## Reflections
Reflection is a crucial aspect of simulation, role play, and games. After the experience, participants should reflect on what they learned, how their perspectives were changed, and what actions they will take as a result.

## Related methods (if any)
Other related methods include:

* World Caf√©: A method for facilitating group discussions and knowledge sharing
* Open Space Technology: A method for organizing self-organized meetings and discussions

## License
These methods are often used in public and social innovation contexts, but they can be applied to various fields and industries.

## Examples
Examples of simulation, role play, and games include:

* The World Economic Forum's Global Shapers Community, which uses simulations and games to address global challenges
* The United Nations' use of simulation and role-playing exercises in its peacekeeping training programs
