# Leadership

## Overview
Leadership is the ability to guide and direct individuals or groups towards achieving a common goal or vision.

## Purpose
The purpose of leadership is to mobilize group skills and resources, clarify vision, and build relationships to drive collective action and progress.

## How it works
Effective leaders transfer their skills and knowledge to others, convene network leaders, and work towards a common intention. They also instigate actions by creating conditions, providing information, and empowering others to make decisions and take actions.

## Requirements
Leadership requires strong communication, collaboration, and problem-solving skills. It also demands the ability to adapt to changing circumstances and navigate complex systems.

## Reflections
Leadership is not about personal power or control, but rather about enabling others to contribute their skills and expertise towards a shared goal.
