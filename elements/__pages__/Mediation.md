# Mediation

## Overview
Mediation is a skill used in public and social innovation work to facilitate communication, resolve conflicts, and find mutually beneficial solutions between parties.

## Purpose
The purpose of mediation is to help parties in conflict or disagreement reach a win-win situation by identifying common interests and finding creative solutions.

## How it works
In mediation, a neutral third-party facilitator helps the parties communicate effectively, identify areas of agreement and disagreement, and work together to find a mutually acceptable solution. This process can be used to resolve disputes, negotiate agreements, or simply improve communication between stakeholders.

## Requirements
Effective mediation requires strong interpersonal skills, active listening, and the ability to remain neutral and impartial. Mediators must also have a deep understanding of the issues at hand and be able to facilitate constructive dialogue.

## Reflections
Mediation can be an effective tool for building trust and fostering collaboration among parties with differing interests or perspectives. However, it requires careful planning, preparation, and facilitation to achieve successful outcomes.
