# Conceptual branding

## Overview
Conceptual branding is a tactic used in public and social innovation work to highlight the value of an initiative, even when financial resources are scarce.

## Purpose
The purpose of conceptual branding is to create a compelling narrative around an initiative's value proposition, making it more attractive to stakeholders and potential supporters.

## How it works
This tactic involves developing a clear and concise message that communicates the initiative's unique value, benefits, and impact. It requires identifying the key aspects of the initiative that set it apart from others and emphasizing these strengths in a way that resonates with the target audience.

## Requirements
Effective conceptual branding requires a deep understanding of the initiative's goals, target audience, and competitive landscape. It also demands strong communication skills to craft a compelling narrative that engages stakeholders and inspires support.

## Reflections
Conceptual branding can be an effective way to build momentum for an initiative, even in the absence of significant financial resources. However, it requires careful planning, execution, and ongoing evaluation to ensure its effectiveness.
