# Reaching unreachable communities-unusual beneficiaries

## Overview
Reaching Unreachable Communities-Unusual Beneficiaries is the ability to identify and engage with individuals or groups that are not typically considered in traditional service delivery, such as marginalized populations, those living in remote areas, or those who do not fit into mainstream societal norms.

## Purpose
This skill helps social innovators to design services and solutions that cater to the needs of these often-overlooked communities, thereby increasing their access to resources and opportunities.

## How it works
Social innovators with this skill are able to scan for connections between seemingly unrelated issues or systems, identify opportunities for collaboration, and adapt their approach as needed to reach these unusual beneficiaries. They remain open to change and willing to challenge traditional assumptions about who should be served.

## Requirements
This skill requires a willingness to think outside the box, challenge existing power dynamics, and engage with communities that may be difficult to access or understand. It also demands a high degree of adaptability and creativity in designing solutions that meet the unique needs of these communities.

## Reflections
Developing this skill involves recognizing one's own biases and assumptions about who should be served, as well as being willing to learn from and with the communities being targeted. It requires a commitment to ongoing learning and self-reflection to ensure that services are truly meeting the needs of these unusual beneficiaries.

## Related methods (if any)
This skill is closely related to Design Thinking, Co-creation, and Participatory Action Research, which all involve engaging with stakeholders in the design and implementation of solutions.

No specific license or permission is required for this skill, as it involves a mindset shift rather than a proprietary approach.
