# Sell de-risk

## Overview
Sell De-risk is a tactic used in public and social innovation to mitigate risks associated with implementing new ideas or projects.

## Purpose
The purpose of this tactic is to reduce the perceived risk of adopting a new solution by providing evidence and data from experiments, thereby increasing the likelihood of successful implementation.

## How it works
This tactic involves conducting small-scale experiments or pilots to test the effectiveness of an idea or solution. The results are then used to demonstrate the potential benefits and de-risk the investment required for full-scale implementation.

## Requirements
To implement Sell De-risk effectively, organizations need access to resources for experimentation, a willingness to take calculated risks, and a culture that values evidence-based decision-making.

## Reflections
This tactic requires a mindset shift from traditional approaches, where decisions are often based on intuition or assumptions. By using data and evidence, organizations can make more informed decisions and reduce the likelihood of costly failures.

## Related methods (if any)
Sell De-risk is closely related to other tactics such as Experimentation, Piloting, and Evidence-Based Policy Making.
