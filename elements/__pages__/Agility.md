# Agility

## Overview
Agility is a key principle in public and social innovation, enabling organizations to adapt quickly to changing circumstances and remain responsive to emerging challenges.

## Purpose
The purpose of agility is to enable organizations to be flexible and resilient in the face of uncertainty, allowing them to pivot when necessary and stay relevant over time.

## How it works
Agility involves being open to new information, willing to take calculated risks, and able to adjust plans and strategies as needed. This requires a culture that values experimentation, learning from failure, and continuous improvement.

## Requirements
To be agile, organizations need to have a strong ability to collaborate across functions and levels, be willing to challenge assumptions and conventional wisdom, and prioritize adaptability over rigid planning.

## Reflections
Agility is not just about being fast or efficient; it's also about being able to learn from failure and use that knowledge to inform future decisions. It requires a mindset shift away from traditional top-down approaches and towards more collaborative and iterative ways of working.

## Related methods (if any)
Design thinking, prototyping, and experimentation are all related methods that can help organizations develop agility.

## License
No specific license is required for agility as it's a principle rather than a method or tool.

## Examples
Examples of agile approaches in public and social innovation include the use of design sprints to rapidly prototype solutions, the adoption of lean startup principles to test assumptions and iterate quickly, and the implementation of agile project management methodologies to facilitate collaboration and adaptability.
