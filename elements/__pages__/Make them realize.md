# Make them realize

## Overview
A tactic used in public and social innovation work, "Make them realize" involves using techniques to help individuals or organizations acknowledge their lack of knowledge or understanding about a particular issue.

## Purpose
The purpose of this tactic is to encourage experimentation and learning by making people aware of the limitations of their current knowledge and understanding.

## How it works
This tactic typically involves using phrases or statements that convey a sense of uncertainty or doubt, such as "I'm not sure if...", "We don't know yet...", or "Let's experiment to find out...". The goal is to create a safe space for people to admit what they don't know and be open to new ideas and approaches.

## Requirements
This tactic requires a facilitator or leader who can create a non-judgmental and supportive environment, as well as participants who are willing to be vulnerable and acknowledge their limitations.

## Reflections
Using this tactic can help build trust, foster collaboration, and encourage experimentation. However, it may also require careful handling to avoid creating defensiveness or resistance.

## Related methods (if any)
This tactic is often used in conjunction with other methods such as Design Thinking, Co-creation, and Participatory Action Research.

## License
No specific license is required for this tactic.

## Examples
Examples of using "Make them realize" include a facilitator saying "I'm not sure if we're on the right track here, let's try something new" or a team leader asking "What do we know about this issue?" to encourage participants to share their knowledge and limitations.
