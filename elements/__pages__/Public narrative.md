# Public narrative

## Overview
Public narrative is a tool used in public and social innovation to mobilize people based on their emotions.

## Purpose
The purpose of public narrative is to understand the background and values of the audience, and use this understanding to craft a compelling story that resonates with them.

## How it works
Public narrative involves identifying the core values and emotions of the target audience, and using these insights to create a narrative that speaks directly to their needs and aspirations. This can be done through storytelling, dialogue, or other forms of communication.

## Requirements
To use public narrative effectively, one must have a deep understanding of the target audience's values, emotions, and experiences. This requires empathy, active listening, and a willingness to adapt and evolve the narrative as needed.

## Reflections
Public narrative is not about manipulating people with facts or data, but rather about connecting with them on an emotional level. It requires a genuine commitment to understanding and serving the needs of the audience.
