# Convening actors

## Overview
Convening actors is a tactic and skill used in public and social innovation work to bring together different stakeholders, organizations, or individuals with diverse expertise and perspectives.

## Purpose
The purpose of convening actors is to facilitate collaboration, build relationships, and leverage collective knowledge and resources to address complex problems or develop innovative solutions.

## How it works
Convening actors involves engaging with various stakeholders, including community members, experts, policymakers, and other relevant parties. This can be done through meetings, workshops, online platforms, or other formats that encourage dialogue, sharing of ideas, and collective problem-solving.

## Requirements
Effective convening requires strong communication skills, active listening, and the ability to navigate complex relationships and power dynamics. It also demands a deep understanding of the issues at hand and the ability to identify common goals and interests among diverse stakeholders.

## Reflections
Convening actors can be challenging due to differences in perspectives, values, and priorities among participants. However, successful convenings can lead to meaningful collaborations, new insights, and innovative solutions that might not have been possible through individual efforts alone.
