# Diffusing intelligence insight

## Overview
Diffusing intelligence insight is a tactic used in public and social innovation work to share knowledge, data, and solutions with others.

## Purpose
The purpose of this tactic is to make the insights gained from problem-solving or research accessible to a wider audience, promoting collaboration, learning, and replication of successful approaches.

## How it works
Diffusing intelligence insight involves digitizing data collected in the field, writing documents to share knowledge, and making solution designs open to others. This can be done through various channels, such as reports, blogs, or online platforms.

## Requirements
To effectively diffuse intelligence insights, there should be a clear understanding of the target audience and their needs, as well as a willingness to share knowledge and collaborate with others.

## Reflections
This tactic requires a mindset shift from keeping solutions proprietary to sharing them openly. It also demands a level of trust in others' ability to use and build upon shared insights.

## Related methods (if any)
This tactic is often used in conjunction with other social innovation tactics, such as Co-creation or Open Innovation.

## License
No specific license is required for this tactic, but it's essential to consider the terms under which data and solutions are shared to ensure they can be freely used by others.

## Examples
Examples of diffusing intelligence insight include open-source software development, crowdsourced problem-solving platforms, and publicly available research reports.
