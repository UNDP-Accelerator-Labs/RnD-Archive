# Learning questions heuristics

## Overview
Learning Questions Heuristics is a tool used to refine research or learning questions by applying a set of criteria.

## Purpose
The purpose of this method is to guide R&D activities and ensure that research questions are well-formulated, objective, and relevant to the problem at hand.

## How it works
This tool involves taking an initial question and iteratively refining it based on six criteria: (1) real questions, (2) objectively worded, (3) interesting, (4) reflecting the stage of research with sufficient specificity, (5) scope that reflects available time and financial resources, and (6) ethical considerations.

## Requirements
To effectively use this tool, one needs to have a clear question to begin with. It is also essential to consider the knowledge gap and the need for accelerating learning in a particular area.

## Reflections
It's essential to remember that there is no perfect learning question, and it's crucial not to spend too much time on refining questions. Good learning questions help feed curiosity and identify areas where more knowledge is urgently needed.

## Related methods (if any)
This tool is related to data collection, ethics, experimentation, exploratory making, and Solutions Mapping.
