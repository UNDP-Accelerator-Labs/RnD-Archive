## Description: What is it? (max 1,500 characters)



Defining a good learning questions are they key starting point of any R&amp;D learning loop or project. These heuristics or criteria will help you refine your questions and make sure they are geared towards generating interesting new insights on a problem or issue.

## Purpose: Why do we use this method or tool for R&amp;D? (max 1,500 characters)



To guide our R&amp;D activities

## Summary: Describe in one sentence, what it is and what it does? (max 120 characters)



The tool will help you refine your learning questions based on list of heuristics or criteria to formulate good research or learning questions.

## Instructions: How is it used for R&amp;D? What steps to follow?



Take your initial question, and step by step, consider the following criteria to rewrite your question once and again, until all criteria are met.  
  
Criteria for Defining Research Questions.  
  
(1) They should be real questions.  
  
Things that we (as individuals, as UNDP, as development institutions, as design researchers, as scholars in academia) don’t know the answer to.  
  
They should worded as questions, i.e. end with a question mark.  
  
(2) They should be objectively worded  
  
They should not presume or contain their answer  
  
(3) They should be interesting—something important is at stake in their answer  
  
Connected to social, political, environmental problems  
  
Connected to debates about these issues  
  
Answers that can be answered yes or now typically are less interesting than questions that should be answered with an explanation.  
  
(4) They should reflect the stage of research with sufficient specificity  
  
Descriptive questions versus analytical questions  
  
Empirical questions versus theoretical questions  
  
Questions that make you think about a design or solution vs questions that make you think more about a problem or phenomena  
  
(5) Their scope should reflect the time and financial resources available (100 day cycles).  
  
Analytical and theoretical questions should signal the categories, variation, and relationships that are under study.  
  
(6) Good research questions are also ethical questions. Is the research question an ethical one?

## Requirements: What is needed to effectively use it for R&amp;D? (e.g. skills, conditions, inputs, resources)



Have a question to begin with.

## Reflections: What to keep in mind when using the tool for R&amp;D purposes?



Knowledge gap is the starting point of the learning loop  
  
Good learning questions help feed curiousity  
  
where do we need to accelerate? where do we urgently need more knowledge?  
  
There is no perfect learning question (don't spend months on this)
