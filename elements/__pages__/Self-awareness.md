# Self-awareness

## Overview
Self-awareness is a key principle in public and social innovation, recognizing that practitioners are not impartial or invisible, but rather, they do disrupt the systems they aim to improve.

## Purpose
The purpose of self-awareness is to acknowledge and manage one's own emotions, expectations, and biases when working on complex social problems. It involves being aware of one's limitations and the potential impact of one's actions.

## How it works
Self-awareness in practice means recognizing that solutions may not always be effective or sustainable, and being willing to learn from failures and adapt approaches accordingly. It also involves being empathetic towards the people you are trying to help, meeting them where they are, and understanding their needs and perspectives.

## Requirements
To apply self-awareness effectively, practitioners need to cultivate emotional intelligence, engage in self-reflection, and prioritize self-care. This includes acknowledging one's own biases and limitations, as well as being open to feedback and learning from others.

## Reflections
Self-awareness is essential for building trust with the communities you serve and for developing effective solutions that are grounded in reality. It requires a willingness to confront one's own emotions and expectations, and to be humble in the face of uncertainty.
