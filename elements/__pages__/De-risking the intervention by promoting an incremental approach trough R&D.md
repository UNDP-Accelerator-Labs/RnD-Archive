# De-risking the intervention by promoting an incremental approach through r&amp;d

## Overview
De-risking the intervention by promoting an incremental approach through R&D is a tactic used in public and social innovation to minimize potential risks associated with new or untested interventions.

## Purpose
The purpose of this tactic is to reduce uncertainty and increase the likelihood of success by breaking down complex problems into smaller, manageable parts that can be tested and refined incrementally.

## How it works
This tactic involves using research and development (R&D) to test and refine an intervention in a gradual and iterative manner. This may involve piloting small-scale versions of the intervention, gathering feedback from stakeholders, and making adjustments before scaling up.

## Requirements
Effective implementation of this tactic requires a willingness to experiment, learn from failure, and adapt to new information. It also requires a strong understanding of the problem being addressed and the potential risks associated with different approaches.

## Reflections
This tactic can be particularly useful in situations where there is limited data or evidence on which to base decisions, or where the context is highly uncertain or dynamic.

## Related methods (if any)
Design thinking, prototyping, and experimentation are related methods that may be used in conjunction with this tactic to promote an incremental approach through R&D.

## Examples
Examples of de-risking the intervention by promoting an incremental approach through R&D include:

* Conducting small-scale pilots to test the effectiveness of a new program or service before scaling up.
* Using design thinking and prototyping to develop and refine an intervention in response to stakeholder feedback.
* Engaging in iterative testing and refinement of an intervention based on data and evidence from previous iterations.
