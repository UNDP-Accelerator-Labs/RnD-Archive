# Never deplete social capital, always increase social capital.

## Overview
Never deplete social capital, always increase it is a guiding principle in public and social innovation that prioritizes the preservation and growth of community relationships, trust, and collective capacity.

## Purpose
This principle aims to avoid antagonizing or separating groups within communities by promoting inclusive and respectful collaboration. It seeks to create an environment where all stakeholders feel valued and empowered to contribute.

## How it works
To implement this principle, practitioners should:

* Respect local structures and consult with community leaders
* Navigate power relations to ensure participation from diverse voices
* Avoid cooperation fatigue by rotating participants and avoiding over-reliance on the same individuals
* Create safe spaces for respectful dialogue and knowledge-sharing
* Foster enabling conditions that promote resilience, critical thinking, creativity, and problem-solving within communities

## Requirements
Practitioners should be aware of their own biases and power dynamics, and strive to create an environment where all voices are heard. This may require ongoing self-reflection, active listening, and a willingness to adapt approaches as needed.

## Reflections
Implementing this principle requires a deep understanding of the community's social capital and a commitment to preserving it. Practitioners should regularly assess their impact on community relationships and make adjustments to maintain or increase social capital.

## Related methods (if any)
This principle is closely related to the "Do No Harm" approach, which prioritizes avoiding harm to communities and promoting positive change. Other relevant methods include participatory budgeting, co-design, and community-led planning.

Examples of successful implementation of this principle include:

* Community-led initiatives that prioritize inclusive decision-making and collective problem-solving
* Collaborations between organizations that respect local structures and power dynamics
