# Never deplete social capital, always increase social capital.

## Purpose/ reason: Why is this important?

This principle is related to the do no harm, specifically to avoid antagonizing or separation of groups in communities. Divisions may be produced by the external cooperation because either you convene only some groups, or because consensus is not correctly managed. When communities feel they have to “compete” for prizes, recognitions, participation, social capital would then be depleted. Therefore, some of the bullets below are guides to avoid depleting social capital:  
  
- Respect the local structures (indigenous)- consultation must be done to all leaders, respect their role. - Panamá has a guide  
  
- Navigate power relations to ensure participation.  
  
- Avoiding cooperation fatigue- meaning that the same participants are convened by different organizations, and they are tired of attending workshops, trainings, etc.  
  
- Create safe spaces- (Ecuador has a Protocol for safe spaces for gender awareness wokshops)  
  
- A safe space participatory workshops refers especially to creating an atmosphere of respect, empathetic listening, and willingness to reflect on practices or preconceived ideas from a critical perspective. To do this, all participants must know the rules of coexistence, which are agreed upon collectively from the beginning. Some of these norms refer to confidentiality, transparency of data collection and use, non-judgment, and respectful debates, which allows the construction of collective knowledge. It means being present not only from reason, but from the heart and implies openness to unlearn and, therefore, to leave our comfort zones. (Principle taken from Ecuador's Protocol)  
  
- Enabling conditions that foster solutions/ resilience; that is contribute to a community’s social capital so that it becomes resilient, critical, creative, and solves their problems.
