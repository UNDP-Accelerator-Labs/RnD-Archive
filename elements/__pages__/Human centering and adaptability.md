# Human centering and adaptability: less of me, more of them

## Overview
Human centering and adaptability is a principle that prioritizes the needs and perspectives of users in social innovation work.

## Purpose
This principle is essential because it ensures that solutions are designed with and for the people they aim to serve, rather than imposing external ideas or assumptions. By putting users at the center, social innovators can build trust, foster co-creation, and develop contextually relevant solutions.

## How it works
Human centering involves immersing oneself in the user's context, respecting their cultural norms and practices, and being open to learning from them. Adaptability requires embracing failures as opportunities for growth and scaling solutions over time, rather than trying to impose a preconceived solution.

## Requirements
To apply this principle effectively, social innovators need to be willing to listen, learn, and adapt. This involves developing cross-cultural competencies, being aware of one's own biases and assumptions, and creating space for user co-creation.

## Reflections
Human centering and adaptability require a mindset shift from "I" to "we," recognizing that social innovation is a collaborative process. By prioritizing the needs and perspectives of users, social innovators can build more effective and sustainable solutions.

## Related methods (if any)
Co-design, co-creation, participatory research, and contextual inquiry are related methods that support human centering and adaptability in social innovation work.

## License
This principle is not proprietary or copyrighted; it is a widely accepted best practice in social innovation.

## Examples
Examples of successful applications of this principle include the development of mobile health services in rural Africa, where local communities were involved in designing and implementing solutions that addressed their specific needs. Another example is the use of participatory budgeting processes in urban areas, where citizens are empowered to make decisions about public spending based on their priorities.
