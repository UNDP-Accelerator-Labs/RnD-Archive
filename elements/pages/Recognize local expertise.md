# Recognize local expertise: Nothing for us, without us

## Purpose/ reason: Why is this important?

- This principle has to do with how knowledge is produced. It parts with the idea of collective production of knowledge, horizontally (no one knows more than others).
- Stop treating communities as beneficiaries but as experts. Traditional project design decides a priori what are the needs of a community, whether they are skills or tangible solutions. However, those affected by problems are the experts and must understand their own problems, prioritize them and come up with solutions. They are the most informed.
- It's ok to say you don't know.
- Avoid data extraction by co-creation, thus giving back has to do with co-understanding of learnings.
- Nothing for us, without us.
- Bottom-up thinking
- Giving up the idea that you know (top-bottom) "I know whatÂ´s best". Be open minded into receiving- blank canvas. Solutions may come at the end.
- Get rid of the main character symptom.
- Appreciate failure- learning is the ultimate goal.
