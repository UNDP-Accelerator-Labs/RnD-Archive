## Description: What is it? (max 1,500 characters)



Quasi-experiments are studies that aim to evaluate interventions but that do not use randomization. Similar to randomized trials, quasi-experiments aim to demonstrate causality between an intervention and an outcome.

## Purpose: Why do we use this method or tool for R&amp;D? (max 1,500 characters)



This method helps to evaluate interventions/solutions/innovations during field tests (in communities and h/h) and helps to generate evidence to understand the impacts of the intervention/solution/innovation. Although not fully experimental it provides an avenue to prove a concept that can built upon for a fully randomized evaluation.

## Summary: Describe in one sentence, what it is and what it does? (max 120 characters)



Quasi-experiments are studies that aim to evaluate interventions but that do not use randomization. Similar to randomized trials, quasi-experiments aim to demonstrate causality between an intervention and an outcome.

## Instructions: How is it used for R&amp;D? What steps to follow?



It is an evaluation design method that can be used when trying to understand the impacts of an intervention/solution/innovation. A control group is required and could also be baseline of the intervention group. Dependent on conditions, pre and post effect of the treatment need to be observed (through a survey/data collected through the use of a digital app). Data then needs to be analyzed and presented.

## Requirements: What is needed to effectively use it for R&amp;D? (e.g. skills, conditions, inputs, resources)



You need a solution that addresses a challenge that has been identified by the community that are willing to implement the solution. 2. Although this work can be carried out by AccLab staff, an independent evaluator maybe necessary in conditions that the AccLab is supporting implementation of the solution with the communities (this removes bias in data collection). 3. Data Analysis skills 4. Story telling skills to translate and present results of the evaluation into usable information.

## Reflections: What to keep in mind when using the tool for R&amp;D purposes?



No inference can be derived from this process.
