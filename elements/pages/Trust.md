# Trust/Authenticity: Build trust as a must

## Purpose/ reason: Why is this important?

- Prior informed processes are important. Before convening communities, you create an atmosphere of respect and trust. They need to agree on the objective of the activity.  
  
- Authenticity- because we deal with peoples who have had histories of betrayal.  
  
- Is it ok do say you don't know but encourage curiosity to find out or discover together.  
  
- Manage expectations and regulate our own expectation (you are not the main character)  
  
- Failure on the project side is OK, but don´t fail the community.  
  
- Navigate power relations to ensure trust and participation.  
  
- Being original helps avoid duplicating efforts
