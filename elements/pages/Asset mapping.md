# Asset mapping - nothing for us, without us


## Tactic description: When do you apply this tactic? How does it work?

- Working with a community, sometimes we must work with gatekeepers in order to gain access and trust.  
- Starting by mapping the assets within the community, which skills are present in the community, enables the community to value how rich they are and feel encouraged to see they have what they need to address the issues in question.
