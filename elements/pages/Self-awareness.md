# Self-awareness

## Purpose/ reason: Why is this important?

- We're not impartial or invisible, we do disrupt; R cannot be alone (R&amp;D)  
  
- Emotions (around failure, around not helping everyone, not helping enough)- a good development practitioner applies Self-care.  
  
- Doubt solutions- sometimes what seems a solution it is not.  
  
- Learn to manage your own expectations. Assess where people are and meet them where they are.
