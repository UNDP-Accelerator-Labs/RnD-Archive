# Deep listening to map beyond the tangible: Listen deep and show you are listening.

## Purpose/ reason: Why is this important?

- Solution mapping is more about intangible than tangible things- that is, we see the people, the conditions, the context, etc. that enable a tangible solution.  
  
- Deep immersion is necessary to be original and don´t duplicate efforts.  
  
- See the collateral and unexpected results when documenting impact.  
  
- Ethnography enables deeper understanding.  
  
- Open-mindness

## Description: What is it? (max 1,500 characters)



Deep listening is a set of qualitative tools that contribute to exploring community narratives and  
accurately identifying in-depth needs, challenges and opportunities. Deep  
listening tools and sessions also help in co-creating solutions to these issues  
via the inputs of the target community itself.

## Purpose: Why do we use this method or tool for R&amp;D? (max 1,500 characters)



Deep listening is used to gather community narratives, i.e., patterns of subjective perspectives  
and experiences of people, which can further influence what is believed to be  
possible or not in in a certain societal context, and thus, determine the success  
of socio-economic initiatives within the territory in question. Deep listening  
also creates a safe space for experimentation and strengthens trust with and  
among a community. Deep listening is especially useful in emergency settings or  
in periods of rapid change.

## Summary: Describe in one sentence, what it is and what it does? (max 120 characters)



Deep listening is a sense making method for identifying general perspectives as well as the needs and challenges of a  
community.

## Instructions: How is it used for R&amp;D? What steps to follow?



STEP 1: Choose at  
least two listening channels. These can include existing channels such as  
participatory community meetings or suggestion boxes.  
  
STEP 2: Create the  
first list of potential interviewees and organize and manage an interview  
agenda. The initial list of interviewees can include 5-10 people, after which  
the initial interviewees will suggest additional participants as per the model  
of ‘snowball sampling’.  
  
STEP 3: Develop  
questions that can gather information from a broad spectrum of levels and  
hierarchies and push the understanding deeper as the listening process  
continues.  
  
STEP 4: Sensemaking.  
Contrast and validate narratives gathered in the listening process.

## Requirements: What is needed to effectively use it for R&amp;D? (e.g. skills, conditions, inputs, resources)



This tool requires a diverse group of participants to contribute relevant experience and  
perspectives to the chosen challenge. It is also essential to obtain  
interviewees’ consent prior to the interview and reinforce that the entire  
process is confidential. Interviews can be supplemented with field notes and  
photographs.
