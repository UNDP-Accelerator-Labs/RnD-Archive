## Description: What is it? (max 1,500 characters)



Narrative analysis is a tool for identifying and categorizing narratives, i.e., subjective  
perceptions that people or communities have over their own lives. Narratives  
can be classified into surface narratives, hidden narratives, and  
metanarratives.  Surface narratives represent  
opinions openly expressed in conversations that do not inform actions in a  
coherent manner (for instance: one can say they are committed to protecting  
human rights but act in a different way). To explore the actual perceptions  
influencing behavior and actions, hidden narratives are identified to dig into  
the beliefs of people on causality, or why things are the way they are.  
Further, metanarratives are the underlying convictions that lie underneath the  
core of the issue. Metanarratives are considered assumptions or values that can  
drive systemic transformations.

## Purpose: Why do we use this method or tool for R&amp;D? (max 1,500 characters)



Although narratives demonstrate subjective perceptions, they are helpful in designing and  
implementing initiatives as they provide in-depth insights into local realities  
and provide an insight into whether local communities genuinely believe that  
change is possible in the current context.

## Summary: Describe in one sentence, what it is and what it does? (max 120 characters)



Narrative analysis is a sense making method for differentiating between narratives, i.e., the  
subjective perceptions of individuals or communities on their current  
conditions, to gather in-depth insight into local realities and willingness to  
change.

## Instructions: How is it used for R&amp;D? What steps to follow?



STEP 1: Extract main  
quotes from deep listening/consultation exercises.  
  
STEP 2: Classify quotes  
by engaged people, main topic area, subtopics and tag words (key words)  
  
STEP 3: Analyze  
quotes based on similarity, difference, frequency, correspondence, sequence and  
causality.

## Requirements: What is needed to effectively use it for R&amp;D? (e.g. skills, conditions, inputs, resources)



Narrative analysis requires a pre-implemented deep listening/consultative session and the  
recordings and transcripts of these sessions.
