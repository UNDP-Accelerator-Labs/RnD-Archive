ODK (Open Data Kit) is a powerful open-source software platform that enables researchers, field teams, and other professionals to collect data efficiently, both online and offline.

## Instructions: How is it used for R&amp;D? What steps to follow?



In most cases, users of ODK:  
  
Create forms using the XLSForm standard in Excel or Google Sheets.  
  
Upload forms to an ODK Central server.  
  
Download forms into the ODK Collect app on an Android device.  
  
Use Collect to fill out forms.  
  
Upload survey data from Collect to Central.  
  
Analyze or export data from Central.

## Requirements: What is needed to effectively use it for R&amp;D? (e.g. skills, conditions, inputs, resources)



The data collectors should be able to; read and write, save and input the data, have internet so that the saved 'offline' forms are uploaded, have a google drive space to download the forms for survey analysis, have gadgets such as tablets that data collectors can use while conducting surveys.

## Reflections: What to keep in mind when using the tool for R&amp;D purposes?



Keep in mind that the GPS coordinates may not be accurate as it depends on availability of internet coverage. Also, if you have more than 1 data collector using the forms of 1 projects, they tend to make mistakes and select the wrong enumerator name in the field. so you need to have more than 1 indicator of who the data collector is so that if they make a mistake in one field, you are able to verify with a secondary indicator.
