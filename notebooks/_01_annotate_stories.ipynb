So it's not just digital transformation in terms of tech, but it's also mostly on artificial intelligence, access to Internet, inclusivity, and a whole lot of other facets that have to do with transformation\\. So yeah, that's what I'd like to share about\\. So can you share where did this started and how, how, how did this come about? Yeah, so I suppose this has come about through because we are a global village\\. We are seeing a lot of countries transforming at a very, very fast pace\\. We started to realize that education the way that we knew it to be is no longer actually preparing our children for the future\\. That is heavily digital\\. And I think as a parent myself and as well as a development worker, I've realized that we realized that this is a trend\\. And when we looked at our, our country in, in that sense, we then realized that it is also a topical conversation in conferences, on the news, the government, the, you know, everybody is talking about a digital transformation in some way or some in, in, in every forum\\. So with we, we, we, with us being the ACT lab and also keeping our ears on the ground, we realised that this is very, it's a topical issue\\. And then apart from that, consequently within our country office, our programs team came in and said we really need to start supporting our government in this area because they are, they've started rolling out a number of projects and they have been crying out for support and help\\. And it really became something that we had to really narrow down and take a deep dive\\.\n",

            "Yeah, This, this, this development challenge is, is quite big in the sense that if you if you don't jump on the digital work on fast enough, it means that you, you, you, the development agenda for that country is also going to be affected in in a very, very big way, particularly with the young people\\. We're starting to realise that there's serious problems around youth unemployment and the way that we knew employment to be is no longer working\\. So there's a lot of industries that we haven't tapped into in terms of the digital space\\. There's now countries that are trading skills that are digital\\. There's also digital services\\. There's quite a number\\. There's a bouquet of development challenges can that can be solved by a simple migration\\. And also not just that, it's also the access to services that if you are right now, if you're there's, there's so many inconveniences about the manual processes that we have all been used to\\. So if you have government in your pocket, for example, which is one of the big projects that our government has actually aspired to begin this year, it is something that we, we thought we could really look into\\.\n",

So it's government in in a nutshell\\. It's also the private sector\\. There's a lot of missed opportunities that have been realized in trade because of the slow pace maybe that we have been moving in transforming like digital payments and small businesses are not able to fully, you know, trade with the global world\\. And also there's, there's the, the part of technophobia that we need to address\\. And there's the people that have come in and said, you know, I'm worried that I'll lose my job\\. How can I quickly trans or transform to a digital, you know, skilled person?

And you know, like the marketing terms that the push pull strategies\\. But, but in this case we've, we've found we are, we are in an ecosystem where everybody is ready to absorb and, and, and actually listen to this story of digitisation\\. So the minute we start discussing anything to do with it, it was just scaling on its own and receiving the support and attention\\. So for us, it wasn't really difficult to, you know, think hard about different and technique, highly specialized strategies\\. But I think the the other one that I wanted to mention is the partnership strong\\. Identifying strong partners has been one of the key strategies that we have identified that help us to be the trust one of the trusted partners on this on this journey\\.

You need data collectors because right now it is very difficult to better understand the infrastructural issues and gaps that we currently have\\. So we need research researchers, which is what we believe we are offering\\. We need data scientists, people that can give us the, the, the, the give us, you know, help us monitor the progress with numbers, tangible numbers so that we, we, we can easily measure our progress with time\\. We need people that can that are ICT or technically competent in this area so that we know that everything that is being put on the table has been quality assured and it has been well thought through in what we are providing as as guidance\\.

And I think having someone that can properly guide you through with this process is also another important skill to consider, having your own board\\. And I think with the, with the ACT labs having invested so much time in learning and understanding the digital transformative journey and having such a large network of countries that have done amazing work\\. We've, we've heard of other labs having done their Dras 2 years back and US only starting just now\\.
