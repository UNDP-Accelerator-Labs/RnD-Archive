      "So I worked on a project aimed at promoting digital financial inclusion in my country\\. So it was a policy advocacy initiative and it had five key components\\. One of the first one was media engagement, then Policy Research, capacity building, training for journalists, regional engagement with regional think tanks\\. These were the key components\\. And the final strong component was establishing a closed door policy dialogue platform where we brought together these key stakeholders from private sector, government, academia in development organizations together to discuss policy reforms needed for promoting digital financial inclusion\\.\n",

      "So we conducted 3 core Policy Research\\. One of them was financial interoperability\\. So in my country, we had interoperability among banks but not among mobile financial services\\. So that was a gap that we identified through our project\\.So we did a policy study on that to advocate for financial interoperability platform that will allow mobile financial services to inter be interoperable\\. That was one\\. And we also did quite a few regional studies focusing on the digital financial inclusion for marginalized communities, for example, the marginalized farmers, the ethnic plainland ethnic communities, which are minorities in my country and also the ultra poor in the wetland, very hard to reach wetland areas in the country\\. I think that we need that to also inertia\\. So the Policy Studies we did media engagement where we disseminated the findings scheme, policy messages from the studies and the closed door policy advocacy, policy dialogue platform, it's called Enablers Network, where we brought together the key stakeholders from private sector business leaders, government officials, they all came together for this policy dialogue and it was closed door\\. So under Chatham House role, they were able to speak freely about their grievances\\. And in order to build the financial interoperability platform, the private sector business leaders had a chance to discuss among themselves what the transaction fees would be, whether their market shares would allow them to come on board with the platform\\. So these sort of things that do not they do not usually get a chance to talk about with the policy makers, but this platform really helped as a tool for them to discuss the policy grievances\\.\n",

      "\n",

      "[[Tools capture card:Collaborative design of actions]]\n",
      "So one of the tactics was that one is its closed door\\. So they can they feel confident, they feel safe speaking in this platform without fearing any retaliation from policy makers, enforcers or financial authority or anyone\\. So that was one and building their confidence in us as non government think tank kind of spaces\\. So our role was often enabler\\. We were trying to build an enabling platform where they can discuss the policy grievances\\.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "[[Principles capture card:Empathy]]\n",
      "So, So one of the key skills that I found came very useful was the ability to read the room S When you have diverse stakeholders in one room, you need to read the room to understand who is not really speaking up and why, how to make sure that he or she feels free to voice their opinion\\. Also, when you're dealing with marginalized communities, you have to understand where they are individual contexts and they're the kind of obstacles that they face\\. So reading the room in terms of understanding multiple stakeholders is very important\\. And one thing that really comes handy, one skill in policy advocacy is not taking credit\\. So as an enabler, you should not try to take credit\\. You should actually let others take credit\\. Your role is often enabler\\. So if someone feels happy taking the credit and it gets the job done, then that should be it\\.\n",

      "Well, the most tangible impact was that a financial inter, the platform, interoperable digital transaction platform that was developed by the policy makers as a result of this policy advocacy initiative, which allowed the mobile financial services to be interoperable with among themselves also with banks\\. Other intangible impacts or outcomes I would say where of course the journalists developed a capacity and learning of digital financial inclusion\\. What are the what is financial interoperability?

      "You'd engage more\\. I mean, we did try to engage the private sector, but not all of them were on board with the initiative\\. So I will probably try to bring more private sector stakeholders involve them because they are the ones ultimately providing the solutions to for example, women LED micro entrepreneurs with financial solutions, financial products that will cater to their unique needs\\. For example, the farmers that we interviewed marginalized farmers, they were not using digital financial services simply because they do not need the existing financial products that are being offered by mobile financial services\\. So they have their unique needs and its is the private sector which can actually develop tailored solutions for these communities, marginalized communities\\. So more prototyping of tailored solutions involving the private sector\\.\n",
