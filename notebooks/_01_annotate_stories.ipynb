So, the work that we're doing around this, this challenge is how to bring innovation to the university and how to meet the research skills that are available there with the growing demand of solutions outside and how do students can develop solutions based on technology to the country's development issues and above how to align all those to the national priorities and the sustainable development goals\\.\n",

The second one is that the classes that the university students are taking are not taking into consideration enough innovation and then when the research are made, they end up in library not being implemented\\. So that's how we started having this reflection with the university\\. And then the opportunity from Timbuktu came in where RBA launched this Timbuktu initiative and then were asked to design A Unipod, which is a space for innovation, experimentation to solve these challenge that we're facing\\. And also the critical gap between skills and demand on the market\\.\n",

      "Cool\\. The main stakeholder is the University of Lomé which is collaborating with UNDP on this, but not only the university working with the Ministry of Higher Education, also working with private sector and also with other development partners which are interested into the initiative\\. The role, how are they contributing to this journey? Because it started with the reflection\\. Even though we have a design of what we want to do, the UNIPod, it was like an architecture that was conceived and then the different components, we build them together\\.  So, the collaboration that they were willing to give on this particular matter helps a lot\\. True along the way because you were like, there's no purpose of building a UNIPod of setting up a space and most of the project is closed\\. Then maybe next year you go around, there's nobody because there's no appropriation of the of the project\\. So, we really took time to get them on board to strengthen their capacity in terms of appropriation and then understand why is it was important for them\\. It's true that there was some existing initiative on the universe in the university around innovation, but they were really at very small level\\. S,o we were like, why can't we convey all of those initiatives together within the Uniport and then build something strong that can save all the ecosystem, but not only, not only the University of Lome, but also the other public university like University of Cara and also private university in the country\\. But above that also we're trying to, it's like a value chain that we are completing\\. There are a lot of, let's say incubators around in the town, but in terms of space for prototyping and experimentation, there's a gap there\\. So all the startup that are in town, all the innovators are also welcome within that put that we are setting up at University of London\\.\n",

      "Yeah, I think one main ingredient is their openness, because the more we were discussing and taking time to design the process, the more they were like, OK, probably we need to take in account what you are saying\\. And they also bring into the discussion other partners that they were working with, other perspectives\\. So, they were like, not only they were willing to work with us, but they were like, OK, I think we had this good idea when working with, for instance, the French Embassy\\. Let's share with you and see if it can sustain the, the project\\. And also once we were ready and then the, we have a common understanding of what they were really not to put in money\\. And that's what they brought some of the equipment acquired by the university, which is something very important in terms of sustainability because it's hard to find most of the time when UNDP implement something\\. We come with everything all in one\\. But we, we have a, let's say we have a deal and then the board part of equipment UNDP also bought some and we build a building, we set up the building and then also they are engaging on also the staff\\. So, mean that they're going to pay the salaries for the experts that are coming to work and to sustain this work\\. So, being open on both sides and transparent help to bring more than the reflection, more than the intellectual part, but also commitments in terms of making it sustainable\\.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "## You already touched on some of the parts actually of the RnD elements, which are the principles\\. It seems like sustainability\\. You already mentioned accessibility as well, openness as well\\. So, I think we you've got that landed already\\. So, maybe we can pivot to what were the tools or methods that you used here and what factors influence you to say this is the tool I'm going to use?\n",

      "OK, you know, working with university lecturers that are really very intellectual and let's say they have this well known for their field of expertise\\. You need to be very humble when working with them and knowing that you're not the experts in their field, but you bring something that is new to them\\. But they want everything to be proved in a scientific way\\. So, even to the level of details that you have to give for the specification\\. So, there was a lot of work that was done on the market research together with them\\. So, one of the tools was data collection that we use through the analysis of the data, we're able down to convince them that, you know, there there's a gap here and there's a demand from this particular skill within the UNIPods\\.  Why, for instance, do we need to set up an electrical lab? Because there was a demand based on the company that is now coming to the country\\. Why do we need, for instance, to set up something around mechanical engineering? Because there is an industrial platform that is built and then we need to develop those skills for the youth so that they'll be able to provide solutions for those companies\\. If, for instance, there is a need on a machine, usually what is happening is that people will reach out outside for experts\\. So if there's a possibility for us to have it here, we should and we should work on it\\. And it's only data that where was the way to prove it right so that they get on board\\. I think aside data, we could also mention probably adaptability because what we prove along the way was that things that we set up did not work out always as we plan them\\. And then when you take for instance, university have two semesters, so after a semester you need to get students through a particular curriculum\\. So how do we design that curriculum once we start implementing that project also was key or determinant in the process?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "## Excellent\\. You just to share here in the interview\\. I think you also kind of combined tools and tactics\\. So just to see in terms of tools, I hear lots of data like data tools to articulate as well as mapping tools to better understand strategic use of resources so that you don't overlap as well with these resources\\. And that two tools has enabled you to build that tactics, right? Like because to work with academia, it seems like data and evidence based data is very important\\. And so those tools have enabled you to build better relationships and to engage with academia\\. So I think you've answered all three\\.\n",

      "I think the first one will be communication because knowing how to address to those lecturers, knowing how to talk to the private sector, which formally not have, does not have any particular relation with the university\\. Even with UNDP, sometimes you have a hackathon, you call them to be part of the evaluation committee\\. But above that, there are very few activities that you run with private sector as well as the university\\. So, you are like, OK, for private sector, you can have an issue like through the running of your company or maybe an opportunity on the market that you want to seize if we reach out to the university, but through this space\\. So the more you were able to articulate and communicate to them, what was the purpose of the initiative helps us to go through, let's say, to grow, to go through it smoothly\\.\n",

Well, thanks for sharing that\\. I wanted to look at in terms of like, now we're kind of reflecting on the journey\\. Well, we're sort of the impact or outcomes that have materialized with what you shared and any learning so far\\.\n",

      "OK, thank you for this\\. I think right before I jump to that, maybe I could also talk about the human approach in the design of this because you know, where there's an issue around the project, the first thing that we usually do to send an e\\-mail and then you know how you've observed that this could we have a meeting and talk about this\\. But in this particular journey, what I've used the most was, you know, reach out to the person directly, maybe text to the person or have a call before even\\. You raise the points or the matter to a level of meeting which is more formal\\. And by doing so, people were feeling more, they feel that you consider them\\. And then it, you build a relationship trust with the team so that when there's an issue or so they reach out to you before even maybe the, the, the, the, the, the issue raised to a particular level that should be, that was probably going to be hard to, to solve\\. Then what impact do we have so far? I think I can first talk about the possibility that we had to bring commitment from the university as I was messing\\. That's almost 50% the of the equipment were acquired by the university, which is something that's very, very important compared to all the projects that we've developed in the in the past\\. The second outcome that I can talk about to be able to set up a board of, to manage the, the UNI ports and being able to convince the university that, you know, the space is within the university but does not exclusively belong to university\\. And then now we have private sector in the board, we have different ministry as digital administer of digital economy, Ministry of Youth and Youth and Youth and employment on board means that there is a diversity in terms of thinking about the sustainability of this initiative\\. And of course, UNDP is part of the board committee\\.\n",

      "\n",
      "## Excellent\\. Well, thanks for sharing that\\. So curious about diffusion and catalyzation, right like what strategies or approaches have you done or currently in progress or thinking about that has helped you sort of facilitate the adoption of your R&D you know initiative?\n",

      "OK, let's say what we are thinking about because you have not started diffusing yet, but the reflection is around setting up like a tool\\. So, how to engage with academia for instance, So sitting down with the universal lecturers, for instance, to write down what are the lessons that you've developed together\\. And then this could be used by other universities that want to implement similar initiative\\. That's the first option that we're considering\\. The second one is also around inviting other stakeholders through the implementation or once the program is personalized, meaning that the university, the private university that we mentioned for instance, will be once they come and we start implementing together, they, we, there's a way for us to diffuse this knowledge and experience with them\\. And most important is with the youth that and the student that we, we are training\\. I think we want to empower them by using last year's students throughout the program, meaning that there will be a renewal of staff which will be made very easily\\. So, the more we collaborate with them, the more we associate them to the process\\. They became like our ambassador\\. And then they'll be able to work within and diffuse that through the ecosystem of innovation, knowing that most of them have projects, some even own startup\\. And by diffusing it that way, we show that we reach out a lot of people inside the country\\. That's what we are meant to do with our you innovation\\.\n",
